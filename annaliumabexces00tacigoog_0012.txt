cttat’. 1] TEXT OF THE MEDICEAN MS. [3]

but none of thern can claim any earlier date than the middle of the r5th
century. Many are known not 1ο have been direct transcripta of the
Medicean, and very few are even supposed to be such. The best known
01 them are classed by Walther and Ruperti in two main groups. The
one consists 01 frve¹ expressly stated to have been transcribed from a
‘Codes Genuensis' now lost, and a sixth ¹, the text of which closely
resembles theirs. Another group of six ⁸, called by Walther (with 1000
propriety) the Roman group, shows traces of a common exemplar,
distinct from the ‘Genuensis'. Το these a third group should be added
comprising two Florentiae manuscripts in the Laurentian Library ⁴,
which appear to approach most nearly to the Medicean text. The
affinities 01 the others⁵ have not been traced.

Respecting the source of the ‘Genuensis’ and other parents of these
MSS. nothing can now be known. It should however be noted that the
loss of the two leaves in the 11101 and Second Books 01 the Histories⁸ had
certainly taken place before 1542,l and may have been one 01 the mutila-
tions complained of by Bracciolini in 1428'3 but the lost matter is
preserved in all the inferior manuscripts ⁰. This would show that the
Medicean, if itis their ultimate source, had been already transcribed
before this mutilation happened to it; and it is also evident from the
correspondence that sorne other copy of Tacitus had been seen by
Bracciolini ¹⁰. An alternative theory, that these MSS. were not derived
from the Medicean, but from some other old MS. coordinate with it and
