[24] INTRODUCYION [eune. 111

i'or the rest, the seryile flattery and scathing satire must be leit to
counterbalance and discredit each other.

Our only continuous and consecutive narrative, that ol Dio, shrinks
into the epitome oi Xiphilinus ata point a little before that at which
we recover the guidance ol Tacitus, and is, unfortunately, sornewhat
meagre as a whole in proportion to the general scale oi the history¹;
but on many important points, especially on the conquest ol Britain,
is our sole detailed authority.

From these sources, aided by the miscellaneous ‘farrago ’ oi Suetonius,
our record ol the first six years oi the prince's rule has to be gathered,¹
so sar as it is needlul ior the present purpose to trace its outlines.

It must be borne in mind that Claudius and his advisere, while thus
taking the reins at a moment’s notice, succeeded to no such well·
ordered empire as had been transmitted by Augustus to Tiberius and by
him to Gaius, but to one lull ol confusion and misgovernrnent. The
bloody deed ol Jan. 44 had revived the memory ol the ldes oi March
ol rac. 44, and had shaken the foundations ol Caesarism ; the threads
oi continuity had been snapped, the State had been two days without
a princeps, and the restoration oi the Republic had been debated as
an open question.⁸ The executione and extortions ol the late tyranny
had thoroughly alienated the rich, while the populace, though probably
fortunate enough to be ignorant ol their peril, and deploring the loss
ol what rnust have seemed a golden age ol amusements,⁴ were in
imminent danger os all the horrors ol lamine.u Abroad, Gaius had
unsettled everything end settled nothing; had pillaged 04441,ο stirred up
the long elumbering hostility ol the German tribes, driven Palestine into
open rebellion, flouted the deputation sent to plead ior the persecuted Jews ⁴
oi Alexandria, had created or deposed vassal princes at the humour oi
his caprice, and, hythe murder or detention ol their legitimate rulers,
