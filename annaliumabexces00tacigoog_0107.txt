been conceived on the grandest scale, and to have embraced no mere
ellacement of past disasters, but the creation of a great Roman empire
of tbe East, no less extensive than that of, the Seleucidae, centred in
himself and in bis children, and combined witb bis never-abandoned
scheme of supremacy.in tbe West.¹ The preliminary steps had been
taken by securing the support of the Armenian king and bringing
the Iberian and Albanian tribes of the Caucasian region into a position
of dependence; Palestine was secured by aiding Herodes to expel Anti·
gonus; in the enemy's country tbe support of the powerful subject
Monaeses, probably also that of the king of Media Atropatene, was
reclroned on; and the splendid army of sixteen legions, witb other troops
making up a total of more than roo,ooo, with which Antonius at last
toolr the field, late in the season of 718, nc. 38, was not unworthy
of the enterprise; but the vast scheme ended in ignominiosa failure
and a disastrous retreat, in which only the military genius of tbe general
saved bis army from the fate of that of Crassus. With the sbattered
remnant, nothing further was achieved in the following year than the
invasion of Armenia and seiaure of its liing Artavasdes, in punishment
for his desertion in the previous campaign. The impaired energies
of Antonius would probably in no case bave been equal to further action
on a large scale ; and his dreams of Eastern empire were soon ended
by his fall and death.

We can thus understand the situation which presented itself to his
rival after the victory of Actium and the submission of Egypt left him
free to deal witb it Phraates, thoroughly hostile, and flushed with
recent victory, had been fortunately prevented from taking advantage
of the civil war by a temporary revolution which had driven birn an
exile into Scythia before his rival Tiridates,¹ and was apparently just
then regaining his throne. Armenia, which had been in vassalage
for a generation, was thoroughly alienated by the treacherous capture
of its lting3 whose son Artaxias, after gaining power by national and
Parthian aid, had thrown away the scabbard, lilre Mithridates, by a
massacre of all Romans within his dominions3 and the work of Lucullus
and Pompeius would bave had to be done over again, with such aid as
the petty surrounding kingdoms could furnish.
