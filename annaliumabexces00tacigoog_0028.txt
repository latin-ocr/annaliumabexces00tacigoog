errae. ιιι] LIFE OF CLAUDIUS [19]

Withln these narrow limits is confined all the help that rve can obtain
l'rom Tacitus towards judgr'ng Gaius either in youth or manhood; nor Ι
have rre any reason to suppose that this history, is it had come down
complete to us, would bave tended to reverse, however it might in degree
have modified, the judgement which has gibbeted this tyrant among the
monsters ol mankind.

not thought lit to give at the close oi his lile any general summary oi his
character, as is done in the Annals lor Tiberius,¹ and in the Histories
lor Galba,¹ and also (more briefly) ior Otho³ and Vitellius.⁴

length such account as ve bave oi the fifty-five previous years olbis
private and public lile.

On his early history Suetonius⁸ is our sole authority. It is l rom him
that neget the picture oi the boy born barely a year belore his lather’s
