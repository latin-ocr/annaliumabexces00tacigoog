Our history ol this prince in Tacitus ison the whole as complete
as that of Tiberius: in both some notice is given oi the previous
lise, and a iuli history is preserved oi the greater part ol the rule; in
both an important portion is lost to us which is ill made up by what
can be gleaned lrom other sources. In the 'case oi Nero, the iact that
the lost portion includes the end involves also the loss os any general
judgement which the historian may have thought fit to give by way
oi summary.

We have the notice of his mother’s marriage to Gnaeus Domitius, who
united a descent on his mother’s side irom Octavia to the high lineage
ol his patemal family,¹ and who afterwards narrowly escaped peril oi his
lit'e by the opportune death os Tiberius.¹ His son, originally named
Lucius Domitius, was born at Antium on Dec. 15, 790, an. 37,⁸ and
he himself died of a dropsy at Pyrgi about two years later.⁴ His death
was almost immediately followed, or perhaps preceded, by the exile ol
Agrippina⁸; and the child, thus leit practically an orphan, fell under
the charge ol his aunt Domitia Lepida, but returned aiter little more
than a year to that ol his mother on her restoration by Claudius.⁶ It
is idle to speculato on the supposed effecte oi his aunt’s neglect or
indulgence at this early age ’ς but his subsequent intimacy with her, kept
up till she lell a victim to the jealousy ol Agrippina thirteen years later,⁸
may not have been without a share in determining his propensities.
Besides receiving back lronr Claudius his paternal inheritance, which
, Gaius had seized,⁹ the boy was further enriched by that oi his step-
