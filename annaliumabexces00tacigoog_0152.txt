CHAP. vl CONQUESY OF BRITAIN [143]

It is probable that the successes which marked the first two years' rule
of the distinguished soldier, C. Suetonius Paulfnus¹ (812, 813, au.
59, 60), were gained in the region of North Wales, as we find him
emboldened by them in the following year (814, ren. 61), after careful
preparation of means of transport, to carry the Roman arms into its
furthest recess, and by the occupatiori of Mona (Anglesey) at once to
deprive the rebels of their safest refuge,' and to extirpate British Druidism
in its innermost sanctuary. Even veteran soldiers recoiled at first in
panic from the sacred soil; the shores of which, besides bristling with
armed defenders, were lined with the holy men uplifting their hands to
heaven in solemn imprecation, and with darlr robed torm-bearing
women, reminding them of the furies of tragic legend. Notwithstanding
these terrors, the landing was soon forced, and the firebrands of the
enemy turned to their own destruction3 the massacre had taken its
course, the altars of human sacrifice had been destroyed, the sacred
groves had fallen before the axe,⁸ when Suetonius was hastily recalled
to face the gravest crisis that had ever threatened Roman rule in Britain.

The great rising of the Britons of the eastern districts⁴ is not only
fully described in the Annals,⁶ but also occupies what is a considerable
proportionate space in the Agricola· andstill more so in the abridge·
ment of Dio.⁷ Both authors have duly chronicled. the portents by which
the disaster was said to have been heralded ⁸3 and in Dio we owe further
a description of the personal appearance of the heroine queen; her
commanding stature, stern countenance, flashing eyes, masculine voice,
her abundance of auburn hair floating down to her hips, her golden tore,
embroidered tunic, and thick cloak clasped over it, as she stands, spear in
hand, to address her countrymen.⁸

The causes of the rising, as given by Tacitus earlier in the Agricola,ll
