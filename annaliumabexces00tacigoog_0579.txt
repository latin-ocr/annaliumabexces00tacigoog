leaving the various difficulties oi detail to be dealt with in the notes
on the passage, it is proposed here to discuss some oi the general
grounds on which the credibillty oi the narrative as given by Tacitus
has been called in question.

The narrative brings in no other originating agency than that oi Nero,
who, to divert the imputation irom himseli, ‘sets up culprits' to sustain
the charge3 and the great difficulty oi explaining how the Christiana
came to be selected ior the purpose is either ignored or supposed to iind
its solution in the lact that they were ‘detested lor their abominations’,
and notorious ior ‘hatred oi the human race', and were therefore presum-
ably persons against whom any charge could be believed, aa well as being
sufficiently numerous to glut the public appetite lor vengeance. But
such an explanation seems only to increase the difficulty by its conuast
with the impression suggested irom other sources; according to which
the Christian body in Rome at that date has been believed ιο have been
neither considerable in numbers, nor so well known ιο the outer world
as to have aroused its hatred, or to have then incurred the imputatione
current no doubt in the age ol Tacitus, but which he has been here
thought to have antedated. ii suspicion had arisen or was sought to
be propagated, tracing the origin of the fire to an act oi religione
lunaticism, its more natural objects would have been the Jews, who were
then living at Rome in very great numbers, and who as a body had
twice at least before this time drawn down upon themselves the inter·
