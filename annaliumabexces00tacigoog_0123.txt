by a rapid movement along the Araxes, the complete disappearance of
Tiridatea,¹ and the surrerrder of Artaxata without a battle!

The narrative of the next campaign (¹4· 23, foll.) ia again chiefly
a personal record of Corbulo, of his dealinga with the submissive,
the fugitive, the atuhbom,⁸ his heroic example in the endurance of
drought and beat, as before in that of piercing cold‚⁴ hia economy of
Roman livea* hia escape from threatened assassination! Twice only
are we helped, however slightly, by the occurrence of a definite name
in the vague line of march. From the mention of his ‘passing along
the bordera of the Mardi ’,l it ia inferred that he had marched from
Artaxata round the foot of Little Ararat to the high plain oi Bayazid
and thence, leaving the basin of the Araxes for that of ita tributary
the Balyk, over the watershed of that stream and the Murad at Djadin,
near the foot of the Ala Dagh, and thence along the latter river
through the plain of Alaahgerd or Ariahgerd.' The march must
have begun late, aa we find the army now exposed to the fierce heat
and drought of the short Armenian summer’ (probably about July)
and unable to vary their diet of mere animal food till they reached
a region (perhaps Melangerd) where the corn was ripe (about Auguat).¹’
The locality next given (ι Tauraunitium ') may probably have been the
plain of Mush,¹¹ where they would leave the Murad and atrike south-east
for the Bitlia pass, and thence to Tigranocerta, which could hardly have
been reached before September. With ita occupation, and the reduction,
after some resistance, of Legerda,¹¹ the campaign may be taken to have
closed.¹⁸

The impression produced by the newa of thia campaign at Rome
must be gathered from the fact that a complete change ol policy
was its result. Tiridates had wholly disappeared from the scene, his
feeble attempt, in the autumn or following spring, to re=enter from
Media, had been so crushed as to leave him without apparent hope
