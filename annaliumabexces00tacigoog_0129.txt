the only chance was that of a cosp denaia, which iu anyordinarycase
must have proved a failure, and which only a series of unforeseen
blunders crowned with complete success.

The Twelllh legion was brought up to the Roman head quarters ς und
the whole army, with its wealrness revealed by conoentration,¹ was
advanoed onareconnaisance in force¹ beyond the Taurus μοι’, whence
on the first collision both sides seern to hare receded, the Romans
retreating hasttly to their camp, the Parthian advanoe probably falling
back on their main body,¹ a movement so misinterpreted by Paetus as to
lead him to think that an isolated force of 3000 legionaries on the height,
supported byabody of cavalry on the plain would sudioe to arrest his
enemy's progress. By their speedy annihilation or dispersim, Paetus
was left deprived of his best horsemen¹ and of probably near half his
legionaries‚¹ to hold out with the temnant (nors still further sreakened
by the detachment of a cohort to Arsamosata) till the succour, atlast
urgently implored,' should arrive with Corbulo. That the case was still
not desperate is evidenced by the fact that provisions still remained, and
that the Parthians, though time was all-important, made no attempt to
storrn the samp': nor, to do Paetus justice, is he represented by Tacitus
as himself inclined to flinch from his undertaking,¹¹ but as foroed to
make terrns by the utter demoralization of his troops ¹¹3 which, partly no
doubt, due to their original unfitness for service, had been aggravated
by constantly increasing proof of their leader's incapacity, and finally
brought to a head when the wounded survivors oi the carnage on the
mountain returned to increase the consternation and dismay.¹¹
