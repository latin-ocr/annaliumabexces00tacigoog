Augustus must have rousedespectatlon to its height in 727, ae. ay.¹ This
intention again is stated to have been frustrated in the following year by
the rising of the Salassi and the obstinate resistance of the emundans&

and some doubt may be allowed whether a conquest of Britain. any more
than of Parthia‚⁸was ever seriously entertained, in the light of bis seduction
of the vast army that had come under his command at the close of the civil
nar to a standing peace establishment ol only eighteen legions* lt is at
any rate certain that from tbe year above mentioned the idea of a British
expedition fades out of sight‚⁸ and thanat some time altmwards,somesirnilar
combination of policy and good fortune to that which brought about a peace·
ful solution of the Parthian question· enabled Augustus to save his credit,
and to present his object as substantially gained, without loss of blood or
treasure. Two British princes are recorded by the ‘Monumentum
Ancyranum' to have fied from their land to his protection ² ; and we may
therefore suppose that the event was duly represented at the time in some
light favourable to Roman dignity'3 while some more unmistakable acta
of homage are instanced by Strabo,⁹ who describes the island generally
as rendered friendly. and adds what we may suppose to be the official
reasons against its occupation as a province.¹⁰
