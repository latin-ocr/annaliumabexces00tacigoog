was instructed from the first to maire cremares, ubereby Tiridates was
to be recognized as king, on condition of acknowledging tbe grant

than enough concessiou had been made by the delivery of hostages'
Tiridates had for some nme been deflecto king, was strong in national
support,¹ in constant expectation of effectual help from his brother,‘
and probably led by the inaction of the Romans to doubt whether they

Corbulo was thus forced in 810, nn. 57, to begin hostilities in earnest
by leading his now thoroughly disciplined armyl into Armenia, where
its training was to be compieted by the terrible ordeal of a winter
spent under canvas in probably the most inclement region ever held
as a Roman materquaners! We are told little, save what tends to
bring out the portrait of the general, his heroic example to his soldiers'
bis iron discipline in camp and severity to disobedient officere· his
insight into the treacherous designa of Tiridates,⁹ and the like. We

by some assistance from his brother,¹¹ pursued a system of predatory
attacks, without allowing himself to be drawn within striking distance,
and of hollow attempts to negotiate ι’; that the Romans were compelled
to adopt similar tactics‚¹⁸ aided by demonstrations from the Hiberi
