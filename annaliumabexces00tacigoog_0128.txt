thence in whichever direction we take Tigranocerta to have lain.¹ We
are told vaguely of forts taken, booty (chiefly corn for winter supply)
collected,¹ and long distances traversed,⁸ without any mention of the
presence of the Parthian force, which must have been mainly confronting
Corbulo· But the campaign seems to have begun late,⁸ and a decision
to have been soon taken to discipline the troops, like those of Corbulo,⁸
by a winter in the country, and to postpone the attempt to recover
Tigranocerta till the following spring, when another legion, probably of
better quality,l would have joined him. With this resolution taken, hc
may be supposed to have retired, on the near approach,⁸ rather than
at the actual arrival of winter, to the camp constructed probably on the
north bank of the Murad, not far above its junction with the Kara-
Su’; and, according to the reckoning here adopted,¹· all the following
events were compressed into the lew weeks still left open for active
operations¹¹

Many of the races composing the Parthian empire‚ and especially
those inhabitiug the plaiu of Iran and the adjoining mountain tracts,
were better able than Greeks or Romans to endure the severities of
winter¹⁸3 and once at least before in the history of the Arsacidae, a
decisive victory had been snatched by them in this season.¹⁸ On this
occasion, the information that Paetus had dismissed all thought of being
attached and was giving furloughs to all who had asked for them,¹⁴ that
even the two attenuated legions were not together,¹⁸ and that the camp
was ill-provisioned,¹‘ must have inspired Vologeses with the idea of
suddenly launching on Armenia the force which then faced Corbulo at
Zeugma,¹' when any regular siege was precluded hythe season, and when
