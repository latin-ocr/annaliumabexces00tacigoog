that os establishing along the line ol the Upper Euphrates a scientific
frontier, aiter the model ol those on the Rhine and Danube, guarded by
a sufficient force oi legions and auxiliaries. Such a policy was actually
initiated by the Flavian emperors and completed by Hadrian, with the
result that Armenia ceased to trouble the minds oi Roman statesmen.
But in the time ol Augustus its adoption would have involved serious
difficulties, political and military—R]

The empty achievement os escorting Tigranes 11 to his kingdom by
Tiberius Nero was soon nullified by the Parthian sympathies oi his
family: a repetition ol the pageant by Gaius Caesar was attended by
resistance which cost his lile: the attempt oi the Roman party to set up
the reiected‘Parthian lring Vonones was too dangerous sor the legatus oi
Syria to support 3 and at the death oi Augustus both Parthia and
Armenia had slipped from his control.¹

The fortunate coincidence, that a prince acceptable to Rome, and
even in part oi Roman lineage‚ was aheady the national cholce,¹ enabled
Germanicus in 771, an. 18, to repeat the performance oi Tiberius and
Gaius Caesar withoirt any imposing military demonstration⁸ and with
far more effect. Artaxias 111 obtained firm possession oi the throne ;
and Artabanus, who could not have resisted this combination ol circum·
mances, was conciliated by the removal from Syria (which was soon
followed hythe death) ol Vonones⁴ This peacesul settlement was so
iar successful, that sor some sixteen years we hear no more oi Eastern
politics; but it is evident that Roman influence in Armenia made no real
progress, and probable on the other hand that the armexation ol the
neighbouring kingdoms ol Cappadocia and Commagene to the provincial
empire⁸ gave the party os national independence the more ground ior
thinking that it was from Rome that they had most to iear. lt may well
be that some encouragement from this quarter, as well as his successes
elsewhere and his contempt lor the supposed dotage and impotence os
Tiberius, emboldened Artabanus, on the death os Artaxias, probably
about 787, an. 34, at once to seiae Armenia ior his son, and to address
the old emperor with the most defiant arrogance and insult⁸
