had left Mauretaniae preytowar, Commagene to anarchy, and had
abandoned the great kingdom of Armenia to the control ol Parthia!

The difficulties of this situation were dealt with by the new govem·
ment in a spirit of deliberation and forethought hardly to be expected
of persons taken unawares. The most urgent danger, that of famine,
appears to bave been averted for the present by energetic temporary
measures ;² [a serious attempt was made to construet a commodious
harbour at Ostia, in which the cornships could ride more safely than in
the open roadstead, while in connexion with the new harbour, a new outlet
for the water of the Tiber was made, in order to lessen the damage to
Rome from floods.⁸-P.] Another necessary of life was to be provided in
abundance by taking up vigorously and carrying out to its accomplish-
ment the aqueduct begun by Gaius.⁴ [Claudius also endeavoured to
develop the resources of the valleys of the central Apennines. The
extensive lagoon known as the Fucine Lake was drained,⁶ and the district
with others opened to communication by the continuation of the Via
Valeria to the Adriatic coast, and the construction of a road (Via Claudia
Nova) connecting the Via Valeria with the Via Salaria, the line of this new
road being roughly that of the modern rarlway from Rieti to Solmona-P.]

Another question pressing for immediate decision was that of those
compromised in the recent conspiracy. Tyrannicida could not be
tolerated, and therefore the actual assassins had to die ; but of the rest,
even those who had been talked of as aspirants to the principate, or who
had advocatcd the restoration of the Republic, were included in a com·
prehensive amnesty, and even allowed to win further distinctions; a
similar pardon being also extended to those who had heaped insults
on Claudius at his nephew’s bidding.⁸
