praesens exitiabilis superstitio rursum erumpebat, non modo per
iudaeam, originem eins maii, sed per urbem etiarn quo cuncta
bundique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque igitur
primum correpti qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum multitudo
ingens haud proinde in crimine incendii quam odio humanis

Tacitus or his authorities from the fact
that the Crucifixion of Christ was known
to have uken place in the time of Ti·
berius, aud that the outer world had
heard nothing of Christianity until some
years after that date, and theu intermit-
renrly.

1. exitiabilis superstitio. Any fo·
reign religion, not Greek, would pro·
bably be called ‘ superstitio': cp. a. 85,
er s-⁶0.⁵; uonna ‘Exitiabilis'
issonsedofdiseasein16.5‚a,and
would probany here mesu that it was
pernicions to t e character (eph. 7, 4),
probably in reference to its ‘demtis' (t 3).
It is thus much stronger than the ⁴ super-
stitio prava immodtea’ of Pliny'a letter
(t 8), and would more answer to the
‘malefica' of Suet. (see on l 3).

uon modo, διας i.e. it was so far bom
being confined to Judaea, that it had
extended itself to Rome. The spread of
Christianity elsewhere is not notieed, as
being foreign to what Tacitus had to say:
and the inference of Schiller (p. 437), that
he only knew of it as then exisnng in
these two localitiea, is unwarrauted.

a. ouante . . . stroois aui pudenda,
‘all that is horrlble and shamefni.¹ The
allusion nodoubt is tothe‘liagitia,'viewed
both as hideous crueitiea (cp. ⁶. 24, ²3
40, 1, dre) and as immoralitiea. By say·
ing ‘cuncta‘‚ he would refer also to the
istac or other foreign mysteries, at
wlhich imuoralities were known to take
pace.

3. celebrantur, ‘are constantly prae·
tised': cp. s. 5⁶, a, and note.

4. primum correpti qui fatebantur.
This can only mean, ‘those were first
brought to trial (cp. 3. 28, 53 ra. 42, 4,
erc.) who were admitting the charge' (cp.
ιι. r, π, &alt but it isnot necessary to
follow those who assume that the charge
admitted was thatol incendiarism. Such
manifest incendiarios as are mentioned in
c. 38, 8, if they could then bave been
said ‘fateri incendium ¹, would hardly be
likely, still less would any others (men

religione enthusiasts) be likel to be (as
the tense requires) still openly ackuow·
ledglng the crime when these proceedings
were taken some time afterwards. It re
no doubt true that those who were
‘making open rofession of Christiauity’
would ordinarii} be said ‘ profiteri’ (
‘Cynicam sedam professo H. 4. mih,
not ‘fateri '. But this difficulty would
disappear on the supposition that ihe
Christiana as a body had been already
marked ont by some means as the inoes-
diariee (see Append. p. 580), so that the

chare against him. The expression
couti thus be used with the same pro·
priety aa in Pliny’s letter (l 3): ‘inter-
rogavi ipsos an essent Christiani. Con·

fitentes iterum . . . interrogavi . . . neque

enim dubitabam, qualecumque esset quod ·

faterentur,'&c.

multitudo ingens. The difficnl
raised by these words (see App ἓ. 573
may be lessened hy rememberingt at the
:dhreeih‘hhh sismirlhhtffihcrarrh'enxdstrtahgaeh 'thel
6. 19, 3 bas been thought to mean no
more than twenty executione in one day
(see note there).

5. haud proinde . . . quam. On this
expression (here and ln c. 42, 1, not
altered by Halm to ‘perinde ¹, as usual}
see 13. rr, 3,and note The words woul
appear to mean that although incendus»
ism was that of which they were formally
convicted, there were few, if any, ossea in
which any direct evidence of such was
attempted to be set up; their notorious
‘hatred of the human raoe' being held to
prove their gnilt.
