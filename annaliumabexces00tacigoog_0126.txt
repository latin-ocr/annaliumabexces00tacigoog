cissa. ιν] · ΡΑΙιΤΗΙΑ AND ARMENIA [117]

planation of this turn of events is open to us ; and it is hardly worth
while ιο speculate whether Corbulo may bave foreseen circumstances
likely to male the retention of Tigranocerta during the winter imprae-
dcablc, or whether, being avare, as he must have been, that no other
ultimate solution than the recognition of Tiridates was possible, he
desired either ιο vin the credit of accomplishing it before his
successor arrived, or ιο leave him ιο face the responsibilities arising
out of its rejection¹

The spring of 815, ao. 62, brought vith it the rejection of the
Parthian embassage,¹ and the arrival of L. Caesennius Paetus in
Cappadocia⁸ bringing with him, either aa his instmctions from Rome,
or aa a vaunt on his ovn part, another change of policy, that Armenia
should be freed from puppet kings by becuming a Roman province.⁴
It might be not much more costly to effect this object than permanently
to keep up Tigranes ; but such slight national support as that prince
could command could no longer be counted on, and his threat in
any casevras idle, unless an addition of tvo or three legions to the
normal military establishment was contemplated. Our record of his
' first and only effort ιο reoccupy and hold the counuy is little more
than an elaborately contrasted portrait of the two generals; the one,
cautious and vigilant, strengthening carefuily the defences on the
Euphrates, pushing his outposta gradually into the hostile country,
arrd assuming so formidable an altitude as to male any attack on
his position evidently hopeless⁸3 the other, a braggart in success,
and a covard in the face of disaster, starting, in dehance of what
are made to have been the plain warnings of the gods,⁸ vith an ex·
travagant design, abandoning ir for desultory plunder,² and prematurely
(aa ir vould seem') retiring to the inaction of a winter camp, yet
wording his dispatches as if the whole kingdom lay at his feet,⁰ and,
