cunr. 111] Rutu OF CLAUDIUS ' [41]

the same terme as by others; as one whose unbridled profligacy rnade
a pastime of the interests of the state,¹ whose influence was used solely
to exalt her favourltes or to destroy those who disdained her adwances,
or in any way crossed her poth. Of the ‘many murders perpetrated
at her bidding',¹ we may take as a sample the case with which the
Eleventh Book opens, in which, to appease the mere y’ealousy of wanton-
ness and the further promptings of cupidity, four lives at once are
sacrifieed.⁸ lt is her will to destroy a rival in the affectione of a
pantomimist, and yet to spare her favourite himself ς and the coveted
possessione of the senator on whom the charge is shifted make him
all the more a welcome vistim. Men of the highest rank are ready
in a moment to effect her purpose3 aconsular accuser takes together
all the antecedents of the accused to secure a conviction, and when even
the intimidation exercised by her own presence⁴ was insufficient to
coerce her husband’s judgement, when the graver charges are on the
point of ignominiously breaking down, and the defence had even extorted
some touch of womanly feeling from herself,⁸ the most influential senator
of the day steps in to gratify her still relentless purpose by ensuring
the fate of the accused through a ready stratagem,⁸ while she herself,
by mere force of threats, terrifies Poppaeo into suicide:' two eminent
knights are attacked by the well-worn artifice of a dream story, and

the dotard‚ who had even forgotten that any charge against Poppaea
euisted,⁰ has instilled into him a vindictive hatred of the memory ¹⁰ of
the man whom, if left to himself, he would have acquitted‚ and is
persuaded to heap rewards on those who had taken even an insignificant
share in tbe transaction.¹¹

To such a narrative the only fitting climax is supplied by that of
her last catastrophe; in relating which Tacitus pauses for a moment
to bespeak the readers' credence by an earnest protestation that he
has added nothing to the record of his authorities.¹² The story as it
stands is indeed of so astounding acharacter that it bas been thought
that in some of its most important particulars we bave an audacious
