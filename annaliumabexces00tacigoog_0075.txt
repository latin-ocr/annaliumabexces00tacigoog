Some three years more¹ sufficed sor the career oi Poppm. and to
close with it Nero’s domestic history. At the birth oi her child, she was
raised to the rank ol Livia and Agrippina by receiving the title oi
Augusta,² nor did she during her remaining short time outlive her
influence; and Nero, ii, as was supposed, he had caused her death
by a passionate blow,⁸ was none the less sincere in deploring it. Men

taste was in the same year partially gratified by the device oi a festival,
which, by its exceptional and quasi-family character,¹¹ might seem to
