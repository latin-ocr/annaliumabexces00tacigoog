not without foundation in so far as the scheme of govemment was even
at the outset impracticahle or inconsistently carried out, and passed
into a system showing manifold special vices of its own as time went on.

In the first place, it must have been plain to all who had insight‚ that
the professed return to the Augustam idea of a dual govemment shared
between the princeps and the senate was not reallya bonafide restoration
of what evenat its hest had been in many important points no more
than a riction.¹ The senate, shattered by a reign oi terror of almost
ten years’ continuous duration? had neither the prestige nor the moral
dignity to resume its lost position; nor have we any record of such
discussion of public questions as is found in the best years of Tiberius,³
or even such as the policy of the early Neronian govemment⁴ and the
independence of individual senators (as Thrasea ⁵) combined to realize·
for a short time afterwards. It was therefore no less perhaps from the
necessity of the case than from the deliberate intention to encroach, that
the political importance of the emperors own functionaries is now so
greatly augrnented, and that from this period is mainly to be dated a
new departure in the system of govemment, by which more and more of
the work of the state is taken out of the hands of the senate and its
magistrates, and knights, or sreedmen, as ministers of the emperor and
responsible to him alone, are found presiding over new departments
of state at home,⁸ or with increased power and independence throughout
the empire.⁷ Again, the circumstances under which Claudius had attained
his power had stamped a character upon it and formed a precedent
