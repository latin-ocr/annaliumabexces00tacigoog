NERONIAN PERSECUYION OF CHRISTIANS 425

been as great as Tacitus would lead us to suppose.¹ Itis however
to be borne in mind that the interest of posterity gathered chiefly round
eminent individual martyrs; whence the conception of Nero as a per·
secutor would naturally he rather associated with the deaths of the great
Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul than with those ol obscure, though even
numerous victims, who left no name and appear iu no martyrology.¹

lt will be seen that we do not find evidence in classical or Christian
record for the supposition that this massacre fell chiefly or even jointly
on the Jewish body.³ Nor has any Jewish tradition to that effect come
down to us; and the complete silence ol Josephus, who could not well
either have been ignorant of any such terrible sufferings undergone by
his co-religionists‚ or have failed to record them if known to him, must
have considerable weight in such a case.⁴

On the other hand, the theory that the Jews may have considered
themselves in danger, and may have been enabled to secure their own
safety‚ and to shist the suspicion to the Christiane by means of their
influence at court, though equally unattested, is certainly so lar a ‘vera
causa', that we have clear evidence of Poppaea's leaning toward the
Jews,⁸ and of her interposition on two occasions on their behalf;⁰ to
which has to be added our abundant evidence of their bitter hatred of
the Christians, and previous attempta to arraigu St. Paul and others

before provincial tribunals. We appear thus to see that they had
opportunity, and that probably they alone had motives, for endeavouring
to fasten upon the Christiana a charge likely in auch a state of excite·
ment to win ready belief, and that they must have had power, such as
probably no others would have had, to give such information as to their
