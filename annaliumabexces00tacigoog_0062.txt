one who had loaded his life with indulgences,¹ brought about the cata·
strophe of Oct. ra, 807, no. 54. The praetorians, schooled for more

secured by similar means⁸; and before the same day closed,a single
sitting of the senate had confirmed the youth, who still wanted two ¹

In his sketeh of the rule of Nero, Tacitus has plainly intended each
Book to constitute a period ; and of these, that included in the Thirteenth

At its ourset, the central figure is that of the empress mother, who

had seemed to have gained the aim of all her crimes, and to have 1

only to step into the position won and talre up the reins of power.
With even a small share of the tact and slrill with which Livia had
