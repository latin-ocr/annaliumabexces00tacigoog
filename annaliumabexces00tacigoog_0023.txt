Τιιιι lew scattered allusione in the extant works οι Tacitus to the rule
oi Gaius and events which occurred under it receive some light from
what is said in the first six Books οι his earlier lile and the circumstances
which tended to form his character up to the time when he assumed the
govemment.

We hear οι him as, at two years old, the unconscious sharer in the
perils oi the German mutiny, carried oli in his mother's arms¹ to find a
salet refuge among the Treveri than in the heart οι the Roman legions„³
We are also given to understand that the sight οι the ‘fosterchild ol the
leglons’,⁴ wearing thetiny sandal modelled on that oi the common soldier
ol the canius,⁸ contributed most οι all to the revulsion οι feeling that
turned the arms οι the mutineers, in rude camp justice, against each
other.¹ The incident had not escaped the watchlul eyes ol Tiberius, or
οι Seianus, who nursed the seeds ol suspicion in his master’s mind, as to
the motives ola mother who could allow a Caesar to bear such a nich—
name as ‘Caligula ’,⁷ one which, we may believe, long stood him in good
stead in the mind οι the soldiers.
