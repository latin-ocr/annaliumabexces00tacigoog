NERONIAN PERSECUTION OF ctrttlsmrvs 419

while that oi the Christians is as universally ignored,¹ aud is generally
supposed to have hardly got beyond the stage at which it was reckoned
by Romans merely as a Jewish sect, parted from the main body by what
seemed to be obscure and even unintelligible differences.-¹

The theories which seek au explanation ol these difficulties in
some confusion between Jews and Christiana may be briefly given as
follows :-

ι. Ιι has been conjectured⁸ that the real victims were zealot Jews, ‘
who had taken a local name from Judas ol Galilee, and whose existence
had been so forgotten when Tacitus wrote as to cause them to be
conlounded with tbe Γαλιλαῖοι* proper or Christians, to whom Tacitus
bas appropriated ‘the sufferings which he might with lar greater truth
and justice bave attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost
extinguished’. This opinion, in its original form, has found lewis any
supporters;⁸ but has suggested others to which the same objections are
not applicable

2. It hasbeen thought⁸ that the blow leli on both bodies, but that the
memory of the Christian sufferers has been alone preserved ; that the
name of ‘Christus' as that of the expected Messiah was no less upon
the lips of Jews than Christians, and that the turbulent followers oi
some false Christ⁷ drew down an attack upon themselves, which extended
itsell by their malicious informatius,⁸ or by want ol discrimination in
the judges, to all Christ-worshippers as such.
