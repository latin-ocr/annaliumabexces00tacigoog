intensified his natural vices and eccentricities, and permanently formed
his character. Disgusting manners, gluttony, drink, lust, gamhling,¹
became the propensities of such a life, redeemed to some extent by the
literary pursuits¹ which alone kept him up to any higher levet Indica·
tious are not indeed altogether wanting that his neamess to the ruling
house sntl made him a person of some consideration. He was married
successively to two women of high family, Plautia, Urgulanilla and Aelia
Paetina³; it -was a valuable stepping-stone to Seianus to affiance a
daughter to his young son Drusus⁴ ; even Tiberius in his last moments
considered him among possible heirs, were it not for the wealrness of his
mind,⁸ and left him a better position in his will than he had held in that
of Augustus.⁶

On the accession of Gaius, he emerges from a position of obscurity
and neglect, aud of persoual safety assured thereby, into one of greater
outward diguity, combined with greater real degradatiou, and no slight
actual peril. From a mere knight he becomes senator and consul,⁷ to
be taken to task in his magistracy aud all but deposed from it: and to
be treated with studied contempt in the senate-house·; he is promoted
to a priesthood, to find himself ruined by the expenses of assuming it¹⁰;
he is sent by the senate as spolresman of its deputation to Gaius in Gaul,
to find the distinction go near to eost his life, and (according to some
accounts) to be glad to escape with a duclring in the river ¹¹ ; he is not
only the constant victim of the flouts and blows of Gaius himself,¹² but
also the butt for all the rude horseplay and practical jests of courtiers aud
buffoons at the imperial feasts.¹⁸
