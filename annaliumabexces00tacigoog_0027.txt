[18] INTRODUCTION [CHAP. 111

101100011οΙ with the army 01 Lower Germany, as weil 00 master 011110
own,¹ vus apparently organizing 0 conspiracy, connived at by perhaps
both the surviving sisters 01 1110 Emperor, and supported by Lepidus, his
brother-iudan and irinsman.¹ It is possible to suppose that this treason
00 1001 was already known, and that 1110 projected German aod British
expeditioris were no more than 1110 alleged object 101 collecting in Gaul
such an army as would suffice to cow the German legions, and suppress
the danger without bloodshed⁸3 and that in 011 the rest we have only
some clumsy attempta to sustain the pretext‘

We have also a criticism by Tacitus on the blundering manner in
which Gaius, suspicions 01 1110 011110οη0001 M. Silanus, corrected the
anomaly, previously deemed harmless‚ by which, in Africa alone among
all the senatorial provinces, the proconsul had command 01 0 legion and
01 1110 0001110000 attached to 11.Ι His introduction 01 0 0001 govern-
ment, by placing the legion with its auxiliaries 000010 ‘legatus Augusti ’,
styled ‘legate 01 1110 army which is in Africa ', whose authority clashed
with that 01 the proconsul, was 11011101, 00 might have been expected, in
jealousy and discord⁶5 but the change so 101 commended 11001110 1110
0000000010 11101 1110 010 anomaly was never restored, [though as happened in
the case 01 1110 legates 01 1110 two German armies the ‘ legate 01 1110 army in
Africa’ became ata later period ‘legate 011110 province 01 Νο101010 ’.²-P.]

merely caprice, but 1110 00100οη00 010 policy in which he vas encouraged
by semioriental princelings, such as Herod, that namely 01 posing as a
monarch 01 1110 Ηο110010110 type and therefore as god as well as king-R]
