so numerous men for all parts of the war forces, especially the cavalry and
the fleet, as this old horne of gladiatore and mercenary soldiers'. With
the annexation of Thrace may be connected the transference of Macedonia
and Achaia to the care of proconsule. The legate of Moesia under
whose charge they had been since Α. n.'15 had now sufficient work to du,
and now that both Thrace and Moesia were Roman, Macedonia and
Achaia might be safely left to rank among the ‘unarmed provinces ’.¹

In Gaul it is reasonable to suppose that such seeds of disorder aa
had survived the suppression of the rising under Tiberius ¹ may have been
quickened into further vitality by the baleful presence of Gaius and his
army in 792, nn. 39, and the following year. This may serve to
explain the measure whereby a former decree of Tiberius for the ex-
tirpation of Druidism was to be repeated and energetically carried out.⁸
The object was to get rid of a primitive ritual marked by barbarous rites,
and the use of the black art, and to bn'ng under Roman influence those
of the nobility hitherto educated in the schools of the priests.⁴ Otherwise
these great pmvinces were to be dealt with by concession ol privileges,⁸
and by the patronage which it was natural that an emperor born in Gaul
should lavish on them.

In Germany the long quiet following on the recall of Germanicus and

Gaius⁷ ; and we find the peace of the frontier threatened. The once
