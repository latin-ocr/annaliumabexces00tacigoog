Nicoli ol Florence, one oi the agents employed by him sor collecting
manuscripts. In acknowledging its receipt, Bracciolini writes as follows
(Oct. ar), ‘Misisti mihi librum Senecae, et Cornelium Tacitum, quod est
mihi gratum: at is est litteris longobardis et maiori ex parte caducis, quod
si scissem, liberassem te eo labore. Legi olim quemdam apud uos
manens litteris antiquis; nescio Coluciine esset an alterius. Illum cupio
habere uel alium qui legi possit: nam difficile erit reperire scriptorem,
qui hunc codicem recte legam ideo cura ut alium habeam, si lieri potest!
On further examination, he appears to have determined not to keep it,
and writes again to Nicoli (June 5, 1428): ‘Dedi Bartholomaeo de
Bardis decadem Livii et Cornelium Tacitum, ut illos ad te mittat: intuo
Cornelio deliciunt plures chartae uariis in locis.' The manuscript thus
returned to Nicoli was bequeathed by him to the Convent oi St. Marl;
as appears by an inscription upon it, ‘Conventus S. Marci de Florentia
Ordinis Praedicatorum de hereditate Nicolai Nicoli Florentini viri
doctissimi! From thence it was transferred to the Laurentian Library,
where it is at present preserved. Τὴο manuscript is written on parch-
ment, and the portion containing Tacitus must have consisted when
complete ol 105 leaves (now reduced to 103 by the loss ol two leaves
containing respectively Hist. 1. 69-75, and Η. r. 86-2. a), and contains
all that we have oi these latcr Books of the Annals and the whole extant
partos the Histories, all numbered consecutively as Books XVI-XXI.
At the end ol the several Books is a subscription, ‘Cornelii Taciti Liber
. . . explicit, incipit. . .' The abrupt conclusion ol the roth Book ol the

ἲ Annals has however no such subscription, and the first sentence oi the

Histories is written in red letters ol larger siae, so as in some sort to
mark a new commencement. Also there is no subscription at the end oi
Book XXI (Hist. 5), which leaves off in the middle ol a column, so as to
show that there was no more in the exemplar.

It will be seen above, that, even in the time of Bracciolini, the hand-
writing, besides being in the difficult Lombard character, had in many
places become iaded and indistinct by time.¹ Since that date, a later
hand has endeavoured to reproduce the text ol these passages in the
interlinear spaces3 and, through errors committed in this attempt, many
salse readings have subsequently passed current as the true Medicean
text.

Many other manuscripts¹ os this portion ol the works ol Tacitus exist,
