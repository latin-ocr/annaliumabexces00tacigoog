description ol Rome ina state ol siege, ‘the very sea and river placed
under guard'; armed men pervading the lora, the great houses, even the
suburban districts¹ ; the ‘troops ol chained prisoners' dragged to trial,¹
and the crowd os lunerals in the streets,⁸ cannot easily be reconciled with
the names and facts given in detail ⁴: even the terrible irony ol universal
public thanlrsgiving side by side with universal private monning, may

Our chief interest in the Pisonian conspiracy lies in its having caused
the deaths of Seneca and Lucan. As regards the complicity ol the
former,' his standing intimacy with Piso, and recent withdrawal imm

declined to mix in it; his removal lrom Campania to the neighbourhood
ol Rome at the critical time may have been a coincidence ' ; his alleged
answer to Piso's message rests on the verbal report ola single witness
threatened with torture,¹⁰ and was neither admitted by himsell,¹¹ nor
unmistakable in meaning¹¹ His thorough knowledge ol Nero,
Poppaea, and Tigellinus may well have predisposed him to welcome any
escape from them3 while on the other hand his political loresight, no less
than his age, and the retirement os lile which he had found so welcome‚¹⁸
