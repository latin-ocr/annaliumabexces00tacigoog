CHAP. tvl PARTHIA ANB Annam [125]

To recapitulate the phasea through which the Armenian question had
in these years passed 2-at the outset, the oiier to recognize Tiridates,
on condition oi his achnovvledging the kingdom as the giit ol Rome,
had been made hythe Roman govemment and rejected by the Parthians ¹:
’ at a second stage, when Artaxata lay in ashes, Tigranocerta was
occupied by Roman troopS, and Tiridates was a fugitive in Media, the
oller bad been cancelled, and Tigranes set on the throne¹; and aster bis
vvithdravval there had been at least some professed intention ol reducing
the kingdom to a province⁸t at a third stage, the Parthians had so far
learnt prudence as, even in their bour ol victory, to offer in some shape
the homage which they had at first disdained ⁴: in the last, the condition
of the personal presence ol Tiridates in Rome is insisted on rather to
save Roman honour than as important in itsell3 a lame and impotent
conclusion to so severe a struggle, yet preferable to the only possible
alternative, that of the tenure ol Armenia as a province and tbe permanent
increase ol the military establishment by the soree required to hold it⁵

Tiridates returned to Armenia in 819, an. 66, as its acknowledged
king‘ ς and the settlement had at least the merit oi permanence. The
only expedition subsequently projected by Nero in the East was in the
Parthian no less than in the Roman interest⁷2 the memory oi Nero was
held in friendly recollection throughout those regions even aster his

restoration oi peace, which he signified by Sophene. See Mommsen's comments in
