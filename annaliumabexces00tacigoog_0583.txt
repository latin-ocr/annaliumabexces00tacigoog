to any Neronian persecutiou in a Christian writer is thatin the fragment
preserved by Eusebius¹ of the Apology addressed to M. Aurelius by
Melite, Bisbop of Sardis, about nn. 170, which, without showing any
knowledge ol the circumstances as described by Tacitus, sets forth the
two most wicked emperors, Nero and Domitian, as having become, at
the suggestion of evil counsellors, the only persecutore of the Christians¹
The saruc note is dwelt upon at greater length by Tertullian, who,
though be refers bis adversaries to the statements of their own writers,
aud has elsewhere· distinctly cited Tacitus, shows no knowledge of this
passage of the lhnnals.⁴ By others, as Lactantius,⁸ Eusebius,⁰ and
Jerome,⁷ Nero is spoken ol in general terma as a persecutor, with no
abadon to these many and nameless victimabat as having caused the
martyrdom ol St. Peter and St. Paul; and it is in Sulpicius Severus
alone that any unmistakable following of the narrative of Tacitus is
shown.⁸

There remain also to be noticed allusions in two Christian books of
earlier date than that ol Tacitus and Suetonius, which, without containing
the name of Nero, or referring indisputably to this massacre, seem
difficult to be explained or understood without supposing some distinct
reference to it.

The least open to question is that in the first Epistle ol St. Clement to
the Corinthiam, which is with probability taken to have been written in or
about the last year of Domitian? and which appears distinctly to allude
