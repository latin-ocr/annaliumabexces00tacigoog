cnse. 111] RULE oF NERO [δι]

certainly at that date that we find the first open mark of Nero's dis·
pleasure,¹ which, though followed immediately by an outward show of
reconciliation, must bave leil a sting behind in both minds.¹ After this,
again sor three years we hear no more; and then, without any additional
circumstances to explain it, the attaclr is launched upon him, beginning
with an invective by his oid enemy Capito Cossutianus,¹ followed by a
second prohibition irom the emperor's presence, and a dignified demand
on his part to know the charge against him, which is answered by an
instant summons nithe senate to dispatch the trial.⁴

to point out how important, and how closely touching the emperor per·

as the solemn vows and ratification oi ‘acta' at the beginning oi each

not senatorial duties alone had been thus contemptuously avoided; that

less conspicuous ; even an oid story oi want oi heartiness at the ‘Juve-

oi a charge oi neason and impiety is built up.¹⁴ Still more remarkable
is the way in which his son-in-law Helvidius Priscus, and bis friends
Puconius Agrippinus and Curtius Montanus are thrown in with him, ap·
