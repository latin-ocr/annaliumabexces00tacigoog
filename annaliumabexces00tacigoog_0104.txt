GRH-1¹1] 'RULE OF NERO [95]-

the announcement oi mordere already perpetrated by decreeing such
public thanksgivings as had been‘ usual aiter signal victories.¹ To

complete his demoraliaation, such men as Tigellinus accustomed them·
selves to practice ior their own ends upon his iears,’ as others had
practised on those oi Claudius 3 and the timidity so characteristic ol him
at all stages oi his career' becomes in the last crisis ol his lile a state
os abject terror, in which he is powerless to act ior himself, and is leit by
tbe desertion ol his advisere to his miserable end

Those in the higher ranks who had thus helped to make him what
he was hastened to pass sentence oi deposition and death, to wreak their
vengeance on his memory and name, and to make illusory displays ol
freedom;⁴ while the numbers who had lived on his bounty to his and
their disgrace deplored a patron whose like they could never hope again
to lind.⁸ Those ol them who believed in the news os his death, and
continued long to deck his grave with flowers,‘ were important enough
to make Otho and Vitellius seek their favour by paying respect to his
ιιιειιιοιγιτ many on the other hand took advantage oi the mystery
surrounding his end to keep up the belief that he yet lived and would
return to execute vengeance and msume his rule.⁸ The strength oi
such a beliei is shown by the support given to pretenders, not only soon
aller hia death,⁰ but even some twenty years later;¹⁰ and by the long·
oontinued Christian expectation oi the reappearance oi the arch-tyrant
and persecutor as the coming Antichrist¹¹
