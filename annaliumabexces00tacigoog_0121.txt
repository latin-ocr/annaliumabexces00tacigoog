that the occupatiori of Tigranocerta must be placed late in the autumn,
and that few if any events of importance can have followed within
the same year; certainly not such as involve a reference to Rome
and the initiation of a fresh policy by the government, the mission
of Tigranes, his establishmentin the kingdom, and withdrawal of
Corbulo to Syria¹ On the other band, Egli's supposition that the
capture of Artaxata and Tigranocerta belong to one and tlre same
campaign¹ involves the difficulty of supposing no break of time at all
in so wide a break of narrative3 while his chronology is further com·
plicated by his untenable identification of the ‘miraculum' observed
at the capture of the former city with the eclipse of April 30, 812,
ab. 59,⁸ obliging him to assign an earlier period to the opening of
‘the campaign than the climate of that region would permit* Yet
again, Mommsen’s opinion,⁸ thatin 13. 34-41 the narrative is carried
down to the close of 812, nn. 59, involves the difficulty already
mentioned, of leaving all the events given in 14. 23-26 to be com·
pressed into the one following year. Also we should hardly expect
Tacitus here to antedate without giving some intimation that he is doing
so, especially when a debate in the senate on the events, not likely to
be thus antedated, is subjoined,⁶ and another event, obviously belonging
to the current year, is introduced immediately afterwards by ‘deinde ’.ἵ
lf the year 58 be fixed as the date of this campaign, it carries with
it that of the previous winter spent in the enemy's country ; and wc
are thus on the whole led to conclude that the narrative in ¹3· 34-41
belongs to 810, 811, ιιι). 57, 58, and that in ¹4· 23-26 to 812, 813,
ιιι). 59, 60. But in any decision we have more or less a choice of
difficulties; and some of those belonging to this view will have to be
noticed in their place.

By adopting this chronology, the period of apparent inaction is
reduced to the two years 808, 809, a. ιι. 55, 56. These are taken
to have been spent by Corbulo in the reorganization of forces de-
moralizcd by long inaction. The unfit are discharged‚ their places
filled and the legions made up to full war strength by levies from
the neighbouring provinces, and the whole is welded into an army by
strict and inexorable discipline.⁸ We are also to gather that Corbulo
