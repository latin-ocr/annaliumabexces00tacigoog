department of ‘ accounts'(‘ a rationibus ') and by the freedman¹ in charge
of ic Under Claudius the ‘libertus a rationibus' is clearly a high finan-
cial authority. Itis not clear that he actually received any moneys or
made any payments; he was rather an accountant·general with a staff of
clerks,⁸ through whose books all Caesar's receipts and payments passed,
including any dealings, e. g. by way of loan, with the public treasury of the
Roman people. That suchadepartment should be merelyaprivate depart-
ment of Caesar's household, and its head a hali-servile domestic, was an
undoubted anomaly which Claudius tried to lessen in two ways. lt was
apparently he who made the rule that no private citizen might have a freed-
manbearing the title ‘a rationibus ', and he certainly granted the insignia
of a public magistracy (the praetorship) to the holder of the office, Pallas.

Two other measures of Claudius suggest the same policy. One is the
grant of magisterial jurisdiction to his procurators in fiscal cases⁸3 the
other the substitution of imperial procuratore for quaestors, in the super·
intendence of the comships at Ostia, and in the management of the domain
lanus both in Cisalpine Gaul and in S. Italy.

In foreign affairs tbe most pressing question was that of the Jewisb

the recollection of the intended outrage survived, recalling dangerous
memorias ol Antiochus Epiphanes and the Mamaea, and ready on any
pretext to burst into a flama· By withdrawing the insignia of Roman rule
from the country, and placing Agrippa over the whole dominion which
his grandfather had held under Augustus* the double end was gained of
rewarding a valuable ally, and of securing the temporary tranquillity ol
the country, under the rule of one who, though personally dissolute and
worthless, had the popularity⁸ which a native prince alone could win.
