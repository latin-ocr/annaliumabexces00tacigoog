Many of the conspirators, and of those who perished subsequently,
had lew claims, or none whatever, on general sympathy ; and even the
highest ranked in elevation ol character below Thrasea and Soranus,
to whose iate Tacitus bas given more space than to that oi any others
among the Neronian victims.² Yet, with all that is told us, much is still
leit obscure and unexplained 3 and the real causes which led Nero to
· compass their destruction are mainly matter of conjecture.

Thrasea, though undoubtedly tbe leader ol the extreme section of the
senatorial ‘Opposition ',¹ and a man ol longstanding and pronounced
republican sympathies, had been enabled, although a ‘novus bonro’
from Patavium,³ to go through the course os magistracies and attain the
consulship,‘ and could not therefore bave been always obnoxious to
emperors. ln the early years ol Nero, wben his attendance in the
senate was constant,³ various servile motione had elicited from him
no word ol protest,⁸ and those who had expected greater things had
murmured at the waste of bis strength on trifles²; while even his one
strong step, that oi rising and leaving the house when thanltsgivings and
congratulations were decreed on Agrippina's death,⁸ receives scant
praise srom Tacitus! Three years later, at the trial os Antistius,¹⁰ he
appears as a skillul tactician, leading the majority os the senate in a
course opposed to Nero's secret purpose, but tutty within the terms ol
tbe question,¹¹ and veiling his opposition under well-chosen compliments ¹¹3
while his only subsequent recorded speech,¹³ il conceived in a narrow
spirit of Roman pride, could yet have been in no way unacoeptable to the
court.¹‘ It would seem likely that he had been driven into more pro·
nounced hostility by the ascendancy ol Poppaea, and that his three years
oi continuous absence from his place in the senate ¹⁸ had begun at the
date os the vows and thanksgivings at the birth ol her chttd¹⁸ lt is
