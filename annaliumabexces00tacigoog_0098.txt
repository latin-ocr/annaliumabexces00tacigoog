Tacitus has not leit us even a word ol allusion to the last scene3 but
as the narrative ol all historiens could only have rested on the testimony
os three or lour eye-witnesses, itis not likely that the accounts materially
varied. He would no doubt have delighted to contrast the ghastly
irony, which at the last hour deplored the loss to the stage‚¹ and strove .
even in its agony to bring out scraps ol literature² and forced efforts
of expression,³ with the serenity and sels-possession which had marked
the last hours ol the tyrant's most illustrious victims.

An important historica} question remains to be considered, how sar
the personal outrages and excesses ol the emperor affected the general
administration ol the empire. We have certainly no evidence of excep- ·
tional misgovemment‚ such as the universal disturbance ol settlements
under Gaius, or ol such rampant venality and corruption as was preva-
lent under Claudius ; nor, until the last year, is there evidence of any
general brealrdown ol authority. On the other hand, the reputation
gained in the first ‘quinquennium ’, over-rated, as we have seen reason
to thinlr it has been‚⁴ is lar from being sustained throughout the later ³
period; and we seem to have an impression of mingled wisdom and
wealrness, as il Nero had been never without good advisers,⁸ but
had either listened to them or followed his own impulse as the humour
took him. This may especially be illustrated by the strange interpo-
lation ol the episode ol Tigranes in the otherwise consistent policy
maintained throughout the Eastern war.⁴ The rebellion in Britain was
dealt with ln a spirit ol judicious conciliation ;⁷ the Jewish war was
taken up on a scale befitting its seriousness;⁸ but in neither case had
any previous account been taken ol the widespread and deepseated
causes ol discontent which had led to the outbrealr. Again, in the
midst ol that war, lor which assuredly all the strength avallable in
the East was needed, we hear os two projected expeditioris, that to the
Caucasus, which perhaps at a more opportune time might have been

¹ ‘Qualisartiiex pereo’(Suet. Ner. 49). ⁸ The part played by the ‘concilium
'Heismade to uote Homer (irum principis‘ (see 13.5o,2; ¹5· 25, 2,&c.)
μ’ ὠκυπόδων ἀμφὶ mres alavastria) on mall cases where the emperor had no
hearing the sound of the horsemen in strong personal interest is apt to be

³ Several such are collected by Suet. Nerva are thought to have been among
and Dio, as ‘er o ego nec amicum habeo Nero's later counsellors. (See r 5. 7, 2,
