presented to the embassy,¹ and was uo doubt distinctly intimated in the
new instructions to Corbulo; who (on the recall of Paetus ¹) was now
reappointed >to the undivided command,⁸ with such extended powers as
would appear to imply the possession ofa general ‘imperium procon-
sulare’⁴ 13 the East. His preparations, in accordance with the outward
show of uncompromising hostility, were on such a scale asto betokeu an
intention of complete reconquest The two broken and demoralized
legions which had capitulated were sent back to Syria and replaced by
the two famous legions of his former campaigns, to which were added
that which should have joined Paetus from Moesia, and another now
sent to him from Pannonia: the force being made up by its auxiliaries
and the contingents of neighbouring princes to a strength of prob
ably from 4o‚ooo to 5o,ooo men,⁸ and forming by far the strongest
army in numbers and quality which had ever been dispatched against
Armenia.

We have again, as in former years, the same personal exaltation of
Corbulo. The powers conferred on him are likened to those given in
old times to Pompeius⁸ ; he is made to open out alresh the disused route
of Lucullus* 33 if to recall the memory of that famous campaign in
which 3 force, barely amounting to onethird of that now following him,
had humbled the pride ol the first Tigranes· Vologeses, who had
offered oonditions at Rome as a victor, sends to him as apetitioner and
obtains from him an armistice⁰3 the respect in which his name is
held¹⁰ is such 33 to make Tiridates accept without hesitation at his advice
the terms of submission which had been treated as impossible in the
embassy to Nero¹¹; after an exchange of courteous interviews, it is in
his presence that the dishonour associated with Rhandeia is obliterated
on the same spot 11 by the deposition before the eagles and the emperor’s
effigy of the diadem which Tiridates bound himself no more to wear till
he shouldhave received it again at Rome from the hand of Nero 11; and
it is with his dignified hospitality that the scene is closed.¹⁴

As regards any military operations, our information is again vague
