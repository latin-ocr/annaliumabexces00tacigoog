him and Burrus of being cognizant of the plot beforehand, a charge
doubtfully made,¹ unsupported by evidence, and in itself improbable.
ltlen of that age and experience would hardly have caught at the
suggestion of the freedman, to get up a sham shipwreck on a calm night
in the hay of Baiae.

Thus died Agrippina, at the early age of forty·three,¹ at the bidding
of the son for whom her greatest crimes were perpetrated‚ after having
been for ten years the most prominent woman up to that date in all
Roman history. lt may seern a fitting retribution that one who had
so blackened other reputations by ber memoirs⁸ should have the load
of her own sins aggravated by falsehood‚ and that the greatest known
intriguer should have been the victirn of counter·intrigue; nor bas any·
thing but the atrocity of her murder won sympatby for oue wbose end
was otherwise but a fitting climax to her life.

lt excites surprise that full three years should have intervened before
the murder of Agrippina was followedby the divorce of Octavia and
marriage of Poppaea. But few qualities are more remarkable in Nero
than his timidity, and the manner in which he felt his way from crime
to crime, as if to ascertain gradually how far he could safely venture.
ln the present case, the realization of his own chief longing, the public
exhibition of his accomplishments, though tentative and gradual, yet in
some form began at once; but the elevation of Poppaea from mis·
tress to lawful wife, an object of far more interest to her than to
himself, was so delayed as to make her fear that she had intrigued
in vain. lt was not till his shy, quasi-private appearance as a cha·
rioteer in his gardens⁴ had been succeeded by his entry on the stage
at the Juvenalia,⁵ not till the adverse murrnurs at the institution
of the Neronia‘ had been somewhat silenced by the experience of
it,⁷ not till the opportune death of Burrus had placed the command
of the praetoriana in safer hands‚⁸ and Seneca had retired with
shattered influence into half privacy,' not till the dangerous Rubellius
Plautus had followed Sulla into exile ¹⁰ and both had after an in·
terwal been put to death,¹¹ not till he saw these and all his uther
atrocities regarded as matters of public admiration and enthusiastic
rejoicing,¹¹ that he had courage to turn over another page in his
domestic history.²⁸
