[134] INTRODUCTION [CHAP. v

a severe checir, and the Britons, though Togodumnus had now perished,
appeared in no way dispirited3 whereupon Plautius, iu accordance with
previous instructions, haited the whole armyon the bank of the Thames, and
sent ior further reinforcements¹ and ior the presence of the emperor himself.

in this narrative,the most definite detail is the mention of the Boduni, and
it is agreat question whether itisnot also the most misleading. The name,
which is otherwise unknown, has been naturally taken to be au error of
transposition for that of the Dobuni, who in the time of Ptolemy bad Cori-
nium for their town,¹ and must have occupied a district coinciding mainly
with Gloucestershire. This, added to the statement of Dio that the expedi·
tion sailed westward, ied most modern critics to put the leading-places
considerably further west than would otherwise be supposed? and to taire
the river at which the chief resistance was eucountered to be'as far distant
from the piace of ianding as the Glouccstershire hvon, or some other
stream in that part of the country.⁴ But ou this supposition, the retreat
· of the Britons from any such point to the south side of the estuary oi the
Thames seems wholly inexplicable.⁸ If, on the other haud, we conclude,
