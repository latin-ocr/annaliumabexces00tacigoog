by previous emperors to the Jews are fully guaranteed,¹ and insults to
themselves and their religion, such as a subsequent edict of Petronius,
legate of Syria? shows to have been even afterwards prevalent, were
forbidden. The naming added in one of these edicts to the Jews them·
selves shows that they also bad similarly transgressed, and throws light
on another aet of opposite spirit, whereby the Jews in Rome itself (their
only considerable settiement in the west ⁸) were punished for some act of
turbuience by expulsion,⁴ or at least by inhibition from exercise of their
worship.l This edict of intoleranoe would however seem to bave been
(as in a former case under Tiberius⁸) only temporarily or partially
carried out⁷

In Armenia, the position held under Tiberius was reestablisbed by
releasingtand sending back Mithridates, the king originally chosen by
him,l who was enabled hy the temporary weakness of Parthia to recover
and maintain his authority.¹⁰

The appointment ol another Mithridates to the kingdom of Bospoms
was less successful.¹¹

In Commagene, the wiser arrangement of Tiberius, who bad consti·
tuted it as aprovince,1¹ vas not reestablished, but Antiochus, whom Gaius
had made king ol the country but afterwards deposed and detained at
Rome, was sent back.¹⁸ The other vassal kings whom it bad pleased
Gaius tn set up, such as Cotys of Lesser Armenia,¹⁴ Sohaemus of Ituraea¹⁸
were left in possession. In another corner of Asia, the small free state
of Lycia pald the penalty of its turbulence and anarchy in the loss of its
independence,¹⁸ a change which resulted in its complete Helleniaation.¹⁷
The Rhodians soon afterwards suffered a similar penalty, but only
temporarily.¹⁸

In Mauretania, a restoration of the former state was impossible.
