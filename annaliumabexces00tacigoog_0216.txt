be brought into a space proportionate to the narrative ol' the Annals by
much omission and abridgement.

The sentences ‘advenae in nos regnaverunt,' and ‘Omnia, patres con·
scripti, quae nunc vetustissima creduntur, nova luere: plebeii magistratus
post patricios' (5 rr), seem intended to answer to nearly the whole ol the
first column; the continuation, ‘Latini post plebeios, ceterarum Italiae
gentium post Latinos,’ appears to render the sense of the opening words
ol the second. The sentences ansrvering to the remainder ol this column
are ‘num paenitet Balbos ex Hispania¹ nec minus insignis viros e Gallia
Narbonensi transivisse? manent posteri eorum nec amore in hanc
patriam nobis concedunt' (5 4), and ‘ac tamen, sl cuncta bella recenseas,
nullum breviore spatio quam adversus Gallos conlectum: continua inde
et fida pax' (ξ 9).

The lact that the order ol these sentences does not in any way
correspond to that os those in the original speech would show that
Tacitus, in that process os adaptation to his narrative which he describes
by the word ‘invertere’,' considered himself sully at liberty to rearrange
as well as to condense, and to give the arguments in what seems to him
to be their most appropriate lorm and order.

The style and expression is thus his own, and the tedious antiquarian
pedantry ol Claudius is just sufficiendy suggested to make the speech
characteristic without being wearisome. ·

Our means ol judgement are necessarily much limited by our inability
to compare the speeches as a whole; and it is also unfortunate lor
Tacitus that the only instance in which we are thus able to bring him to
boolr, isone in which such obligations to fidelity as he rnay have desired
to recognize must have been sorely tried by the literary and rhetorical
delects ol his original.

¹ The allusion to the Spaniah origin ol ³ Cp. r 5. 63, 7, where he gives a rea·
