is vaguely described as ‘sharing his madness', the second as ‘the
hereditary enemy of princes’, the third as author ol ‘ detestable verses', ol
which no further account is giveu.¹ That these had followed Thrasea's
course of abstineuce from public life is nowhere etated3 and it must be
inserted that their private and persoual connexion with him is tbe only
real ground of their association in the charge.

We are thus led to suppose that in Nero's present suspicions mood the
existence of such a coterie seemed in itself to be dangerous. Consider-
able in numbers, and comprisiug persons of the highest political aud
social standing,¹ it lived in isolation; much as France has seen Iegiti·
mists, Bonapartists, or Republicens living iu an inner world of their own
under a hostile govemment. With probably no more belief that any ⁵
restoration of the Republic was possible, thau we have seen it to be lilrely
that Lucan had,⁸ tbey yet consecrated their lives to its memory ; they kept
high festival on the birthdays of Cassius and the Bruti; ⁴ their leader was
himself the biographer of Cato,⁶ and bad married the daughter and
namesake of the heroic Arria ς’ his utterances were to them a fountaiu
of inspired wisdom ;' nor was be unwilling to take them into his counsel,

whether to explain his past⁸ or to gulde bis future course3' while out·
side themselves no opinion deserved to be taken into account. Strong

governments have found their wisdom in tolerating such bodies, and even
in respecting them; but in the course of terrorism on which Nero was
now launched, it was easy to persuade him that in dealing with such
opinions he could not stop at the banishment of Cassiua¹⁰

Other difficulties are raised by the attaclr on Soranus, which, while
simultaneous, and apparently concerted with that on Thrasea,¹¹ comes
from altogether distinct accusers and rests on different charges¹¹ He
had certainly not been always in opposition: fourteen years previously,
he had courted Claudius and Pallas by moving a decree of money aud
honours to tbe latter;¹⁸ nor had he ever afterwards talren any part in the
senate which Tacitus bas cared to mention3 nor is be stated to have been
