cunr. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS [27]

senate as a whole by the delerence paid to its authority.¹ It was to be
consulted on all matters os state? as in former times; even the restoration
oi exiles was submitted to its approval,³ and the allowance of a small
guard oi honour to the emperor within its precincts was asked as a
savonr‘: and not only at the outset‚ but throughout his rule, be shows
himself desirous to keep up the dignity of that body, by purging it
of unworthy members,⁸ and by inlusing into it new and healthier blood‘
from the ranks below,⁷ and even from provincial sources.⁸ A similar
recruiting‚ later iu the course ol his rule, of the ranis oi the patriciate,’
would make it easier to fill the lew priestly offices still confined to that
body.¹⁰ Other acts, extending to all ranis alike, were probably in effect
an especial boon to the upper classes. The law of ‘ maiestas ’‚ by which
Tiberius had decimated the senatorial and equestrian aristocracy, was
allowed to sink into oblivion,¹¹ and the princeps solemnly swore that no
Roman citizen should be put to torture.¹¹ It was no doubt by these and
other similar mensures that Claudius won a permanent place among
constitutional ‘principes ',¹⁸ and earned the title of ‘libertatis vindex ’,ι’
while he compensated the lower orders sor the curtailment of the great
shows and largesses ol Gaius ¹⁶ by the gradual abolition oi his imposts,²⁸
and by this and other means gained no slight popularity.¹²

Important regulations were also made in the administration of the
finances ol the empire, which must have become altogether disorganized.

In respect os the ‘aerarium publicum’, it was perhaps a mere strolre
oi antiquarianism to transfer the charge lrom praetors to quaestors3 nor
was the change beneficiat, except sofar as it substituted selection ior
the baphazard os the lot, and allowed time to gain experience by pro·
longing the tenure of office.¹⁸
