definitely specified ; we have the personal outrage inflicted ou Boudicca
and her daughters, the extortionate spirit iu vhich the Romans eracted
the inheritauce left to them hythe old king Prasutngus, the spoliation

had been goaded to despair by the violence of the veteran colonists of
Camulodunum, by the consecratiou of their slavery in the erectiou of a
temple there to Claudius, aud by the exactione of the priests at that alien

pieces, and only the legatus and the cavalry escaped⁸

In endeavouring to retrieve the terrible consequences of his own
negligence, Suetonius had probably as arduous a taslr before him as had
ever fallen to the lot of a Roman general. We may suppose that the
Fourteenth legion had accompanied him to Mona, with perhaps part of
