Nevertheless, the Parthian iringa generally made no acruple oi inter·
posing from time to dme in Armenia;¹ in which, from the appointment
ol Tigranes ΙΙ in 734, ac. ao, we have ior nearly lorty years an almost
continuous history oi interierence and intrigue, resulting in revolution
and anarchy. The account oi these vicissitudes can be read aa related in
its place by Tacitus⁸ ς but it will be well to compare here the alternatim
open to Rome in dealing with this Asghanistan ol the ancient world.

Subsequent experience may be taken generally to have shown that
a policy oi complete non-interierence would have been best, and that the
efforts ol Rome were lar more needed in extending and consolidatiug
the empire in other quarters 3 but Augustus could not slight the traditione
ol the Republic‚ or allow it to be said that even an imaginary limit oi the
empire had receded under him. Also, from the time os the domicile
oi the heire oi Phraates in Rome, the idea oi bringing the Parthian
empire itseli under Roman intluence through a monarch os the stamp oi
Vonones must have been constantly present; and ior any military
demonstration to support a friendly or threaten a hostile king, the most
practicable route was that which rested on Armenia aa a base, and led
along the Tigris to Ctesiphon.⁴ On the other hand, the transitory success
achieved under Trajan cannot well be regarded even aa subsequent evi· =

the Halys· A second alternative, that ol controlling it aa a masal lting-
dom, is the one which we have to consideras maintained throughout this
period, in various forms irorn substantial dependence to mere nominal
acknowledgement ol suaerainty, and always under the great difficulty of
contending with national affinities and sympathy, balanced no doubt by
some dread oi Parthian despotism.⁷ [There was indeed a third alternative,
