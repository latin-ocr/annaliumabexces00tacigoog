cuae. 111] RULE oF NERO [61]

It was again within this period, in the fourth year of his rule,¹ that a
new and overpowering intluence took hold of him, that of the beautiful
and abandoned woman who, adding J'udicious coyness¹ to consummate
profligacy, and combining in herself the characters of the intriguer,⁸ the
wit,⁴ the devotee‚⁸ and the fatalist,⁸ was enabled during the seven
remaining years of her life to keep a firm hold on his affections,i and
to lead him on from crime to crime.

The remainder of this sketcb will deal rather with distinct subjects
than successive periods, and show the way in which various parts oi his
character unfolded themselves. One such subject is almost eompleted in
the Fourteenth Book, which begins with one and ends with another of
the two great atrocities of his domestic life.

With regard to the first of these, the graphic narrative of Tacitus is
confirmed in its main points by other writers, though for much oi the
detail and nearly all the antecedent circumstances he is our sole
authority. ,
It would bean error to suppose that when the struggle for political
ascendancy had been decided against her, and the show no less than the
substance of regency had vanished‚⁸ Agrippina was no longer a force
to be reckoned with. At what seemed then the crisis of her iate‚a single
interview with her son had so worked upon him as to change the whole
face of the situation'; and even as the breach went on widening, the
habit of submission to that terrible will had become such second nature,
that Nero never dared to indulge his longing to exhibit himself on the
stage.¹⁰ Poppaea again could feel that never, while Agrippina lived,
could she hope to become Nero’s wife,¹¹ and that be could easier be led
to compass her death than to dely her openly. So she plies him with all
the weapons of sarcasm, reproach, lamentation, tenderness‚¹⁸ herself well
