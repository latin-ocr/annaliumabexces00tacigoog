Trrs bronze table or tables¹ containing this document were dug up
at Lyons (Lugdunum) in 1524', and are preserved in the Museum of

that city. The inscription appears to have been first printed by Lipsius
in his Excursus to the Annals, afterwards in Gruter's collection of in-
scriptions (502), and often subsequently. The text here given is that of
Boissieu (lnscr. Antiques de Lyon, p. 136>

Itis evident that we have here fragments of the actual speech of
Claudius: the whole os which, together with the decree of the senate
which followed it, was no doubt engraved and set up at Lugdunum, and
probably at other places in the provinces to which it related⁸.

The speech is divided into paragraphs as here given, and in almost all
cases, the end of a word, except where it coincides with the end of a line,
is indicated by a point, and in many, though not in all cases, accents are
placed upon long vowels. A lew errors of the engraver in the divisions
of words, and in the words themselves, are pointed out in the notes⁴.

Α comparison of these fragments with the speech as given by Tacitus
throws much light on the question how far he considered himself at
liberty to ignore such documenta, or to deal with them as he thought
desirable.

On the whole, the substance of the existing portions may be said to
have been given, and the fact that they are represented by but a few
sentences would go to prove that the whole speech (as indeed the
fragments themselves suggest) was long and discursive, and could only
