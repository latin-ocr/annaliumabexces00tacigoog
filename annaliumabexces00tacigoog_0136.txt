that his general knowledge on these points is hardly so much in advance
ot' that oi Caesar and Strabo as we should have expected lrorn his date
and his exceptional means oi information.

In the Agricola he correctly characterizes the results os the invasione
of Julius Caesar,¹ and refers the long subsequent inaction to the civil
wars, the ‘politic lorgetlulness’ of Augustus, and the powerful influence
ol his ideas on the mind olbis successor¹; an explanation which 'be would
probably have set lorth with,rnore detail in the body ol his larger work.

It must be plain that Caesar's professed object in invading Britain³
could have been only very imperiectly and temporarily attained by the
successes gained in it; and that, il he really believed the independence oi
the island to be a standing menace to the peace oi Gaul, he must have
contemplated some permanent occupation ol it; and that this scheme,
though thrown into the background by the great expedition to the East,
on which his energies were concentrated at the time ol bis death, was
among the ideas bequeathed by him to his successore. He bad shown that
to land arr army in the country and to penetrate its lorests was practic-
able, and that the means oi dividing its people by intrigue were ready to
band; that there would be tribea, such as were in his time the Trino
rantes ot' Essem* as ready to invite Roman interference as had been the
Aedui and Remi ol Gaul.

By the partition os the empire under the triumvirate, the execution ol
the dictator's ideas in respect ol the occupatiori of Britain would lall to
the share oi bis nephew, who was apparently so lar penetrated with the
necessity oi sustaining his reputation by an advance in that direction as to
have at least made some show oi preparing to invade this country as early
as 720, nc. 34, when he was recalled t'rom Gaul by the Dalmatian rising.⁵

The idea ol this conquest, though again postponed hythe imminent
cisil war,⁸ is kept prominently before the public mind in the literature
ol the years immediately before and alter Actium' ; and the announce-
ment ol an expedition lor this purpose under the personal command ol
