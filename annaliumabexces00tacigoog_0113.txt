[¹04] INTRODUCTION [crasarv

The narrative os Tacitus¹ gives a lull account of the response oi
Tiberius to this challenge, and the decisive blows struck hy him in
both directions, by instigating the Iberian prince Mithridates to seiae
Armenia,¹ and equipping another and again another ol the Romaniaed
Arsacids, as a leader to the disaffectcd Parthian nobility.⁸ Yet in all
this his habitual cautiori was not lost sight os. His able lieutenant,
L. Vitellius,⁴ was charged to avoid actual collision with the Parthians,⁸
and to give Mithridates no other material help than such aa consisted
in distracting the enemy by assuming a threatening position on the
Euphrates.⁸ The Armenians themselves would seem to have remained
passive while their country became a battle-ground between the Parthians
and the chiel Caucasian nations. Scytbian tribes hired themselves out
as allies toboth, but were in lact present on one side only! The result
showed that the Parthian horsemen were no match outside their own
country lor the more mixed lorces⁸ and superior hardihood’ of the
Iberians and Albanians3 who were not only able to deleat the young
prince Orodes,¹⁰ but e'ven to gain advantage, by superior local knowledge,
over a levy cn masse led by Artabanus himself. ¹¹ The instability os
Eastem thrones is illustrated no less strikingly hythe revolution which,
following on these disasters, and lomented by Roman intrigue,¹¹ drove
Artabanus into exile and destitution in Scythia,¹⁸ and made the
advance ol his rival Tiridates resemble a triumphal procession¹⁴ than
by the rapid counterrevolution which so soon brought the old king
back again, aud returned the pretender, as a discrowned fugitive, to
Roman territory.¹⁵ But in all these vicissitudes Mithridates held his
ground; the powersul Greek city of Seleucia maintained its revolt ¹';
and Vitellius was able, just before the death of Tiberius, to compel
Artabanus to make submission and homage, and deliver his son as
ahostage.¹⁷

Whatever advantage had been gained was soon scattered to the winda
by Gaius, who, on unknown grounds, summoned Mithridates to his
presence and imprisoned him,¹⁸ set up nothing in place ol the govem·
