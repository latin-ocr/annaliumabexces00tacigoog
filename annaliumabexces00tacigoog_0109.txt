[100] INTRODUCTION [cnsamv

the attach, the ‘young ruler destined to be their dread'¹ is urged to
punish the proud career oi tbe borsemen,² whose generals had
‘twice quelled the ill-started onset' oi the legions and adorned them·
selves with Roman spoils¹3 whose bordes were even extravagantly
imagined as ‘threatening the borders oi Latium '.‘ To iace these
‘dreaded' enemies,⁸ and their iamous tactics,⁸ the youths oi Rome
must be trained²3 to lead these in triumph and impose a law on
them⁸ is the national longing; ‘Augustus will indeed bea god among
men when these and the Britons are added to the empire.''

The opportunity which Augustus was thus calmly biding seemed to
have come in 731, nc. 23, when a demand or petition irom Phraates
sot the surrender oi Tiridates, and oi an iniant son oi his own carried
off by him, was met by sending bacls the latter, with a stipulation, which
was disregarded or frustrated by delay, for the surrender in return os the
captives and standards.¹⁰ lt can hardly have been without the co-opera-
tiou oi some internal troubles,¹¹ that tbe mere presence oi Augustus in
Syria three years later, unsupported, as iar as we know, by any more
than the ordinary military lorce oi tbe province, sufficed to win without
a blow all the demands which had been sor so many years resisted, as
wellas the temporary withdrawal oi all Parthian support from the vassal
kingdoms3 so asto enable Tiberius Nero, aiter personally receiving
the standards, to instal Tigranes in Armenia in place ol the already
deposed and murdered Artaxias,¹² and to set ArIobarzanes, son oi the
Artavasdes who had reeently died in Rome, on the throne oi Media.¹⁸

The greatest military achievements could hardly have done more
lor thelame oi Augustus than these bloodless victories, elred out, as
they evidently were, by no small amount oi grandiloquent falsification.
Augustus probably proclaimed then, as later,¹⁴ that he could have made
