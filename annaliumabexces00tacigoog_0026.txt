masis, cast away the last restraints of common decency and prudence,
and follow the bent of a nature long since thoroughly vitiated.¹

When however we consider that, out of the four Books and a half
given to the events of the ten years succeeding the death of Tiberius (a
larger amount than is ever elsewhere allotted to a similar space within the
period of the Amaia), probably two Books were occupied with those of
this principale of hardly four years' duration, we may feel sure that so
weighty a historiari found in it material of morehistorical importance
than such as survives to us in Suetonius or Dio.⁸

It is also to be borne in mind that his purpose professed at the
beginning of his work, of holdinga balance between the extravagances
of adulation and abuse,³ and his belief that he bas succeeded in doing
so, applies to Gaius as wellas to the other princes contained in it, and
makes it probable that in his case, as we have already seen in that of
Tiberius, some of the scandals and outrages which other historians have
raked together would have been discredited, and many incredible ex·
aggerations reduced to their just dimensione.

One general trait of considerable interest has been preserved to us in
the incidental mention that the disordered intellect of Gaius was never·
theless consistent with considerable oratorical vigour⁴; a statement
which may well be illustrated hythe epigrammatic point of some of his
personalities,⁸ and the shrewd, however merciless, lcgic pervading his
repartees and other reported utterances.

'Some of the principal remaining allusions to his acts show that Tacitus
followed the general account of the absurd hasco of the German expedi·
tion‚⁸ and considered that its failure, combined with the characteristic
caprice of Gaius himself, caused the abandonment of what be believed to
have been a seriously entertained project of invading Britain.⁸ Itis
disappointing that we have here no suggestion ofa rational explanation
of these events which seems not impossible. Lentulus Gaetulicus,
legatus of Upper Germany, already formidable under Tiberius, and
