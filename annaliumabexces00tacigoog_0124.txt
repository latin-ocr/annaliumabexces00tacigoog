oi resistance ¹; and he was now lest out ol account, and the old course,
so osten marked by sailure‚ was re-entered, probably early in 813,
nn. 60, by sending out, to be set upon the throne, another Romanized
prince, Tigranes, nephew oi one ol the same name who had ruled
sor a short time in the Roman interest in the last years oi Augustus!
The neighbouring princes were bribed, each by a portion of Armenian
territory, to support the new arrangement⁸ ; aforce oi rooo legionary
and 3000 or more auxiliary Roman troops was leit in the country;
and Corbulo, alter vengeance executed on the disafsecred: withdrew with
his army to Syria,⁸·as it his work was done.

But he must have been well aware that the war, instead of being
over, was only entering on a more serious phase; that to have led
a powerful army from one end of Armenia to the other,⁸ in the absence
os the Parthians, was no real conquest, and that the difficulties would
begin again as soon as the baclrs oi the legions were turned; that
the new king could not hold his own for a day without Roman help,
while his mere presence was a standing dehance which the Parthians
could not but take up with energy; the more so as the long drag of
the Hyrcanian revolt may probably at this time have been opportunely
removed,i and as Tigranes was himself taking up an openly aggressive
attitude, by invading and endeavouring to annex the Mesopotamiam
district oi hdiabene.⁸ We can hardly avoid the conclusion that the
sending out os Tigranes was the act of the horne government, and was
in direct opposition to the policy favoured by Corbulo, and finally adopted,
of coming to terms with Tiridates. Corbulo no doubt realized that
Tigranes* mission could only end in failure, and withdrew to Syria in
disgust.’
