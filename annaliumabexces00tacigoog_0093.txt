had numbered individual victims under the empire,⁸ and though their
reverence ol Cato would associate itsell with his cause, however remote
the constitution ior which he had died might be from any ideal common·
wealth. But now that Lucan had undoubtedly conspired, and Seneca

strange contrast to the philosophie theory, whereby not only was good
government welcomed by the sage as leaving him free lor the higher life)
hut even bad government was not held to call upon him lor a hopeless
struggle against it ;¹ his state was the universe, and in that alone could he
truly busy himself ;¹ he would submit freely aad willingly to that to which
he must submit anyhow,¹ unless his position became such as to justily

accordance with that of Thrasea. But under a reign ol terror, when to
be conspicuous is to be dangerous, worse arguments have been known to
pass muster against an obnoxious citizen: Rubellius had been arr object

look and gesture, imitated by his soar-laced crew, was intended sor an
insolent censure on Nero's life ; ¹¹ his Stoic disdain made the disaffected
