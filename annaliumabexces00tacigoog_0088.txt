himself of the rival who, in the linc in which alone he himself was

energy capable of better things² on the accomplishmeut of pleasure;
wherein his refined air of careless ease and simplicity, contrasted with
the coarse profusiori of ordinary debaucbees,' gave his taste a character
for originality, and made the stamp of his approval necessary before any ¹
suggestion of luxury could commend itself to Nero as sufficiently
recherchl to deserve bis notice.¹⁰ Petronius died as he had lived,
turning from both the shilts and the consolations of other men'n as
he had disdained their commonplace pleasures, and sending to Nero,

for the monotony of his subject, and to bespealr some indulgence for,

of fatality than of wilful cowardice.¹⁴ lt is more pertinent to ask what
