disbelief; and the balance which Tacitus, here as elsewhere, believes
himself to hold, is shown chiefly in a few points which he alone treats as
doubtful, while the authorities whom Suetonius or Dio have followed
had assumed them as certain, but which, when all needful allowance is
made, go for little towards any general reversal ofjudgement3¹ as iano
less the case with other details in which the accuracy of Tacitus himself
seems open to question.¹ Were he acquitted on every one of these
eounts in the indictment, one whose victims included every near relation
that he had in the world, and almost every citizen who had given lusue
to the age, would have but little to gain by the verdict. Such names
as those of Britannicus, Agrippina, Octavia, and Antonia, or such aa
Seneca, Lucan, Thrasea, Soranus, Corbulo (not to mention many others),
are assuredly to be weighed, not merely counted ; and such justification
οτ extenuation as is pleaded in one case or another becomes the harder
to sustain when aliare viewed together.

ln accepting the substantial tmtb of the record before us, it is but just
to take account of the circumstances and surroundings which helped
to form this prince's character. Besides the vicious domestic influeuces
with which tbe training of most young nobles had to struggle,¹ his life
from childhood had been spent in an atmosphere of falsehood, and
among all the machinery of intrigue and crime by which still in mere
boyhood he had risen to power, with even less experience of life than the
worst of his predecessors3 bending his earliest energies to escape by
. fair means or foul frorn his mother's leading-strings, with the aid of a'
brilliant macher, pliant as a reed, and anxious, with (it may well be) good
ulterior airus, to sustain his own influence over him at whatever moral
eost. His earliest crimes revealed to him the utter degradation of the
senate and pcople, who received his most flimsy justificatione with
elfusive servility,⁴ and welcumed the matricide's return to Rome with
all the honours of a triumph3‘ the former body proceeding, as time
