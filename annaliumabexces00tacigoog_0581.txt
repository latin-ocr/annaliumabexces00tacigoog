3. It has been thought² that suspicion may indeed bave first tested
on the Jews, but that the leading members of that body at Rome may
have been enabled by the powerful assistance of Poppaea to shift the
charge entirely from themselves upon the Christiana, whom they detested
and were eagerly secking opportunities to destroy.

In criticizing these views attention must be called to what Tacitus
distinctly states, and to such corroboration of bis statements as can be
⁶ found elsewhere.

It is no doubt hardly relevant to say that Tacitus was himself vell
avare of the distinction between Jews and Christians, and that his
account of the origin and spread of Christianity is accurate as far as it
goes. But his explicit assertion that the ‘Christiana’ were already, at
the time of which he is writing, so known and designated by the Roman
people‚¹ is one which no careful historian would have made if he had
not found them so named in bis authorities, who in this case were
thoroughly contemporary with the events, and describing circumstances
of the utmost public notoriety. There is no improbability in the suppo·
sition that the ‘influa of the Orontes into the Tiber⁸’ might have already
carried to Rome a name already used, probably for some twenty years,
at Antioch ⁴, already traceable as a term of reproach in the East,⁸ and
apparently familiar not many years after this date at Pompeii.⁸ The
sect may well have beenan Tacitus seems to imply, better known to
the common people than to the government‚ though it may have forced
itself on the notice of the latter as early as 810, nn. 57 ;7 and there is
some reason to suppose that at the date of the siege of Jerusalem,
