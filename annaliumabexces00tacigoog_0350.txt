rather to point to some stretch of su·
thority by which they were ln the habit of
intervening in an impending suit before
praetors or consuls, and transferring its
cognitance to themselves (see Momms
Stameni. 146, r; ii. 105, 15 310, r).
That the tribunes continued as late as
the time of Hadrian to exercise some
judieial function (⁴co itio') is plain
from Juv. 7. 228, but w ether by way of
appsal or as a court ol first instance seems

is that suggested by Mr. Greenidge
(Roman Public Life, Append. 2, p. 447)
and adopted by Mr. Hendersou (Nero,

from summoning litigants from an Italian
town in cases whereacivil actioust law
would have been possible iu that town?
The change now made ‘clearly toolr from
the tribune the final decisiou as to when
a civil case should be summoned from a

takes this to mean that in vate offences
committed by members o the household
they should have no ruore power thau

to have been the general rule for all
