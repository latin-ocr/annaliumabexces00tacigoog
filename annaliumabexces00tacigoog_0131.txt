take up new winter—quartem in that country; his own lorce was not on a
large scale¹; and the rabble of Paetus would not be an aid bnt an
incumbrance: still it is difficult to suppose that his instructions from
home tied him as strictly as he implied, or that his position in Syria,
held by three nearly complete and thoroughly efficient legions, tras as
much imperilled aa he affected to apprehend¹

The year closes with the retirement ol Paetus to winter in Cappadocia,⁸
and with an interchange oi messages between Vologeses and Corbulo,
whereby the latter consented to destroy his outpoats beyond the Euphrates,
on condition ol the withdrawal ol all the Parthian garrisona tett behind
in various lortified places in Armenia.⁴ Thus all preparation lor olien-
sive movement was abandoned on both sides, and affairs seemed to have
driited back once more into the position in which the arrival oi Paetus
had found them ³3 but with the difference that Tiridates, the only prinae
who could hold his own in Armenia by national support without ex·
ternal force, was more than ever master oi the situation, and that
the prestige oi victory bad shiited altogether from the Roman to the
Parthian side.

The embassy which Vologeses had been ‘permitted to send'⁸ reached
Rome early in 816, 1. n. 63,⁷ and exposed the hollowness ot the gas·
conading dispatches of Paetus.⁸ The Parthian lting spoke with just
pride ol his success and clemency, and wrote as one who had to offer
terms instead of petitioning. The actual sovereignty of Armenia was
treated as no longer in question3 but Tiridates would consent to do
homage lor it in presence oi the symbols oi the empire at the camp ol
Corbulo, and would even have oliered to come to Rome sor investiture,
il it were not for a religious difficulty.⁹ The council oi Ner0,¹’ driven to
find some means os reconciling the facts ol the situation with the satis-
t'action ot' imperial honour, fastened on the last point as one on which
compliance might be entorted so that they should not seem to have
accepted terma lrom the victor. Outwardly indeed, the Parthian pro-
posals were rejected in a spirit ol defiance3 but the possibility of such
a compromise was understood to be implied in the conciliatory gifts
