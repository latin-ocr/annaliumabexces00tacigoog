seattered Zealots.¹ He himself had construeted a fortified camp at
Emmaus in Judaea,¹ from whence, in one short expedition, he reduced
Idumaea, and in another, Samaria5⁸ subsequently to which another
strong position was taken up at Jencho⁴ After these successes the
reduction of jerusalem alone remained: and sigorous preparations were
being made forits siege when the news of the death of Nero obliged him
to await further instructions3⁵ and subsequent events presented any
active resumption of the war till a year and a half afterwards

Helius, who had frequently pressed Nero to return, went in person to
tell him that a great conspiracy was on foot in Rome, and that his
presence was urgently needed. Nero immediately set sail, and narrowly
escaped shipwreclr from a sturm. Several persons who had counted on
his destruction and rejoiced at it were put to death· His return was
marked by extravagances surpassing all before. He entered Rome
through a breaeh in the walls, after the tradition of victorious Greek
athleteS, in a triumphal chariot, bearing rhe Olympian crown, and holding
in his hand the Pythian, amid the acclamations of the populace,⁷ and dis-
played all his crowns, in number 1808, on the obelislr in the circus, and
again exhibited himself as a charioteer and musieian.⁸

Soon afterwards he left Rome for Naples, where, on the anniversary of

the murder of his mother,' the first news was brought to him that ’

C. Julius Vindex, the legatus of Gallia Lugdunensis,¹⁰ had raised a great
insurrection in his own and in the adjoining Gallie provinces. The
account of the nature and purpose of this rising, in the abridgement of Dio
