MEDICEAN MANUSCRIPT.¹

Tunc which is now known as the second Medicean MS. oi Tacitus is
a manuscript in Lombard characters, generally assigned to the latter hall
ol the eleventh century, and thought by Ritter to have been one ol the
many transcripta oi works oi ancient authors made at that date in the
great monastery oi Monte Casino.

the following subscription, ‘Ego Sallustius legi et emendavi Romae felix
Olybrio et Probino cons. . . . Rursus Constantinopoli recognovi Caesario
et Attico conss? These dates are respectively nn. 395 and 397, and are
taken to be those ol the transcription and revision oi the archetypa] MS.;

the Tacitus, as well as the Apuleius here copied, is in no way evident.
