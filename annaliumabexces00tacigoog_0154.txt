at Isca Silurum, and that he had intended to collect his troops at
Viroconium.¹ But the officer in charge of the Second legion, pleading
perhaps the necessity of holding down the Silures, disobeyed his sum,
mons; the remainder of the Twentieth could hardly, as it would seem,
be withdrawn without leaving Deva at the mercy of the Brigantes; the
Ninth had already marched ou and met its fate. So that the Fourteenth
and part of the Twentieth legion, with auxiliaries making up the total to
about ro,ooo men, were the sole force with which he had to face the
enemy and reconquer the province. At the head of his light auxiliary
troops he moved rapidly along the Watling Street, leaving the more
slowly moving legions to follow. He reached Londinium,¹ but finding
himself too weak to hold it, fell back along the road by which he had
come. Londinium was sacked and Verulamium shared its fate. From
seventy to eighty thousand Roman citizens are computed to have
perished. At some point further along the Watling, he met the legions
hurrying to his support. Thus strengthened, and fearing a failure os

neither be surrounded in the rear nor outflanked.⁴ With this advantage,
the steady valour of the legionaries enabled them to await the decisive
moment when the Britons began to waver under the storm of ‘ pila ⁹, and
to break their centre ina wedge·like column.⁶ The unwieldy mass
became its own worst enemy; the wagons in which their wives had been
brought to see their victory enclosed the rear; the constantly increasing
heaps of slain still funher blocked escape; and the carnage was com-
