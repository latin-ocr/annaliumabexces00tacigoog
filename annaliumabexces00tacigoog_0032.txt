crrse. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS [23]

unavares in full view of the end for which he and his adherents may have
been none the less deliberately laying their plans.

Our most serious loss is that of the record and judgement of Tacitus
respecting the first and best years of this principare, one which we can
the better realize by reflecting how much less we should have known
of the mle of Tiberius, if the first three Books of the Annals had not
come down to us. As regards mere material, it is no doubt true
that our other authorities here do more to fill the gap. Josephus, by
large portions of his narrative, and especially by the original texts
of edicts of the emperor and of Petronius, his legatus in Syria,
preserved init, has given us valuable information on many subjects,
especially on the policy adopted towards the Jewish race ¹: a few facts
of historical interest may be found among those noted by the elder
Pliny 3 to his nephew we owe the touching history of Paetus and Arria¹;
and the reader may derive entertainment, if not instruction, from Seneca,
whose disregard, not only for truth, but even for his own consistency,
allows us to find, in what he says of Claudius, an equally extreme ·
instance of each of the kinds of falsification, in which Tacitus tells us
that the histories of the whole period covered by his Annals abounded.⁸
In the ‘Consolatio' addressed from his place of exile to Polybius,⁴ the
resources of language can hardly find terms for the gentleness and
clemency⁶ of the prince under whom it was the freedman's happy
lot to live, and under whom even exiles rested in peace.⁸ Fortune
is prayed to preserve one granted to the relief of a worn-out age, and
herself bidden to leam from him to be merciful² He is himself
imagined as drawing on the unrivalled stores of his eloquence and
learning to address topics of consolation to his minister⁸; whom the
writer bids to seek his own solace in the sunshine of that presence,l
of that deity within whose influence no sorrow can reaeh him.¹⁰ It is
hard indeed to believe that we are reading from the same author whose
pen has described a monster of cruelty to us in the ‘Ludus '. Sotne
