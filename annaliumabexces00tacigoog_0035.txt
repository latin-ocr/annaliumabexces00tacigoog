[26] INTRODUCTION [cuae. 111

The emperor had also to deline the rule to which he hadsucceeded; and
in this it is hardly too much to say that the lines of the imperial constitution
had to be retraced. The memory of the late tyranny was effaoed, the ex·
travagant titles adopted by Gaius were abolished, his ‘acta’ rescinded, his
exiles, especially his two sisters Agrippina and Julia, recalled, many of his
extortions and confiscations restored to the sulferers or their heire, his
statues were silently removed, his debased coinage was called in.¹

In name and form, the Augustan idea of a citizen prince was to be
restored. The most sacred oath of Claudius was ‘ per Augustum¹’; and,
to associate himself with a divine ancestry‚ he procured for his grand-
mother Livia a tardy deification, with special honours to lreep up her
name.⁸ Further respect was shown to the memory of his still popular
brother Germanicus, his father Drusus, his mother Antonia; and even
her father M. Antonius was honourably mentioned.⁴ By thus promi-
nently bringing into notice his relationships to the previous ruling house,
and by himself assuming the cognomen ‘Caesar ', he would endeavour
to sustain the fiction of a continuity of succession ; though his name was
stili significant ofa change; the house of the Julii Caesares, to which
Augustus and his successors had nominally and by adoption yet belonged„
having been left without any male representative at the death of Gaius,
while no such family as the ‘Claudii Caesares' had ever existed, and the
name would seem to an antiquarian genealogist a strange misnomer.
From this time, therefore, it was distinctly to be understood that ‘Caesar'
had passed from a family name to an imperial title.

The Claudian name was sufficiently near to the Julian to prevent
the few remaining great houses from feeling degraded by its exaltation,
and some of the most prominent were conciliated by politic alliances.
The infant Octavia, whose name recaiied the sister of Augustus (her
ancestress in a threefold line), was promised in marriage to L. Junius
Silanus, the great-great·grandson of Augustus⁵, while Antonia, the
emperor’s daughter by Paetina, was betrothed to Cn. Pompeius Magnus ⁶,
a representative not only of that famous name, but also of the Calpurnii
Pisones, the Licinii Crassi, and Scribonia.

Besides thus winning the support of great families, he conciliates the ·
