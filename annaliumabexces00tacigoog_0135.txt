Nora-ln this chapter, and in the notes on the corresponding portion ol the text,
constant obligations must be acknowledged to Mommsen, Hlst. v. ch. ὅς to Hiihner’s
treatise ‘Das Rb'mische Heer in Britannien' (Hermes, xvi. 1881, pp. 514-584), and to
various notes in his edition oi the inscriptions ol Britain (C. LL. vii); to Professor
Rhys (⁸ Celtic Britain· Londom 188a); and to many other worlrs which are mentioned
iu their plaoe; also to information communicated by Mr. F. Haverfield.

Tur writings ol Tacitus, even in the mutilated state in which we'
now possess them, constitute our most complete and most consecutive
authority for the whole history of Roman invasion and conquest iu
Britain down to the recall oi Agricola (837, 1. n. 84), lrom whom it is
natural to suppose that most ol his information respectiog the country
and people was derived. It is here proposed, aller a slight notice oi
previous events, to enter into so much only ol the subjectas is comprised
in the period ο1 the Annals, so much, that is, as would have been
related in that work, if it had come down complete to us. An eramia-
ation ol his sketch ο1 the geography and ethnology ol the island belongs
more properly to an edition of the Agricola. It is sufficient here to note
