ln relation to Parthia, sar more than to any other part ol the empire,
the dictator Caesar had left to his successors a legacy of war: lor in
this case there was not merely (as in the case oi Britain) a lailure to
be redeemed, but the great military disaster of Crassus to be avenged3

death. The Parthian king, quiclrened bya sense of his danger, seized
eagerly the opportunity which the dissensione of the two leading trium·
virs soon adorded him,¹⁰ and poured his forces over the frontier, under
