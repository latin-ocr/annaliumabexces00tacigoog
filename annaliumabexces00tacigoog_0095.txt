[86] INTRODUCTION [cuae. 111

remarkable fact that Corbulo and the two brothers Scribonius Rufus and
Proculus (the legati of the two ‘Germaniae' ) were all in one year put to
death¹ would show that Nero had conceived suspicion at the same time
of the commandere of all his greatest armies; but nothing whatever
remains to indicate its ground. Beyond these names, we have no detailof
the many cruelties ol Nero in Greece 3¹ beyond the name of Sulpicius
Camerinus, none respecting those perpetrated by Helius aa bis vicegerent
at Rome.⁸ A few words of Suetonius tell us that to the other family
murders were added those of his adoptive sister Antonia‘ aud bis stepson
Rufrius Crispinus5‘ a single line of Pliny alludes to the fate of the six
wealthy possessors of half the province of Africa ς· our accounts of the
reaction under Galba give us names of several delators whose careers seem
hardly to have begun when the Annals break olf. We are told that the
Scribonii fell before the delation of Paccius Africanus 5¹ Licinius Crassus·
and Salvidienus Orfitus⁰ and their families before that of Aquilius
Regulus; that Eprius Marcellus had added other noble victims to Thrasea
and his friends, ¹⁰ that infamy had been incurred on similar grounds by
Vibius Crispus,¹¹ Annius Faustus,¹¹ Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius Attianus,
Cestius Severus 3 ¹⁸ and for exactions or other misdeeds by the freedmeu,
as Polyclitus, Vatinius, Patrobios,¹⁴ Petinus,¹¹ also by Calvia Crispinilla,¹⁶
and others. When to such indicatione we add tbe inference derived
from observing how lew ol the cases mentioned in the extant narrative
of Tacitus would have been known to us without it,¹⁷ we can see how
far we probably are from being able to form even an approximate
estimare of the bloodshed and other acts of tyranny of the last two years

. of Nero.

Among these latest victims our great interest centres in Corbulo, but
as to any explanation ol his fate we have but conjecture to go upon.
