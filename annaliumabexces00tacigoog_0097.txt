[88] INTRODUCTJON [cranam

general and standing grounds oi military discontent as were shown in
the mutiny ot' so many legions at the death oi Augustus against an
emperor ot' known vigour and capacity, who had even been their own
victorious general‚¹ would have been aggravated atthis time by the
news os the conduct os their imperator in Greece and elsewhere, and
by jealousy at the donatives and other giits lavished on the praetorians.⁸
It is again evident that the iate of Corbulo and the Scribonii must have
taught all provincial commanders what they had to expect, and wamed
them that it was safer to take advantage of the discontent of the troops
than to repressit: and that a state ol things would thus come to exist
which a single spark might set in a blase. For the further progress
ol the revolt, the weakness, passing at a step irom contemptuous indit·
1 lerence to abject panic, with which Nero attempted to lace the situation,
would seem sufficiently to account.

As regards the last crisis, that os the defection oi the praetoriana, a
lew words os Tacitus come in to confirm the general account. To this
body their long-standing allegiance to the Caesars⁸ had not only the
iorce ol habit, but was also a necessity ot' their existence: the proclama·
tion of a Republic would have been their sentence os disbandment; nor
had they any desire os their own lor eren a change of ruler. Fourteen
years of laxity and indulgence had taught thern to love a vicious prince
as deeply as their predecessors had ever respected a strict one3⁴ and
the contrast ol Galba could hardly have been more attractive in anticipa·
tion than it proved to be in reality.³ But the intrigues of Nymphidius‘
sound their all-powerlul support in Nero's own cowardice; and a salse
report that the ssight which he uras known to be contemplating had
already taken place left them no resource but to make the best os the
only rival then belore them,' however visionary might be their hope
of the enormous donative offered inhia name.⁸
