done blm more than justice as an orator, both by exemplification and
001101010,ι have called him imbecile on the strength 01 such iaIIIngs
as he hardly cares to notice, such as his pedantry and tanity,¹ or even
the absurd lnequality and absence 01 011 dignity and proportion 10 his
edicts and other public utterances.⁸ The justification 01 such a term
10 rather to be found 10 his unconsciousness 01 patent 10010 going on
around him, his apathy‚ wealrness 01 will and purpose, readiness to be
swayed by those who had the last word with him, qualities by no means
resting on the sole evidence 01 satire.

That his nature was to sorne extent always such, Tacitus undoubtedly,
and perhaps erroneously‚ believed3⁴ buton the other hand, much 01
the contrast between the good and evil reporta 01 him is explained by
difference 01 11010, and hy circumstances which probably did not escape
an acute historian. Itis 10 the outset ol his rule that nearly all his
wisest acts 0101001100011,ι when his own energies were at their best, and
when all about him, 11010 senators to l'reedmen, must have seen that
their Interest lay 10 producing a good impression to contrast strongly
with the preceding tyranny. It is 01101 011 years 01 wearying routine and
unrestraIned sensual indulgence that we find him in the premature
senility and decay which Tacitus represents, and which 110 may haue
traced‚ as in the case 01 Tiberius, step by step; leading to a stage in
which the speech on the Gallie question is almost a solitary 110011 01
energy‚ and such senseless extravagances as the preparation 01 0 great
lieet lorasham fight on lalre Fucinus are hardly to be distinguished lrorn
the wild excesses 01 Gaius3⁸ while the general state 01 relaxed tension,
10 which Rome is again brought as near to lamine as it had been under
the misgovernment preceding his rule,⁷ important imperial interests are
