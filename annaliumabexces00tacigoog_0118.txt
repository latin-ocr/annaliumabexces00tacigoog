we find an absence ol all strategical details, and rarely get even clear
indicatione of time or place.¹ ln the practice ol grouping the events
ol two or more years together, so much is sacrificed to literary effect
as to leave the time ol the year, and even the year itselt, and the
distinction oi one campaign lrom another, to be made out from some
incidental allusion to season or climate ; and again, the general features
ol the physical geographyoi the country are wholly ignored; the situation
of important places is assumed as known or lest altogether vague; and
it is only here and there that the mention of some definite locality gives
any indication of the routes taken or positione occupied. Nor are the
delecta less serious in the political history. The policy and instructions
ol the Roman government, the nature ol the negotiations between the
contending parties, and the terms proposed or rejected on either side,
are oltener left to be gathered than expressly stated

For most of these desecte, Tacitus must himself be held responsible.
We can hardly suppose that the chronology of the campaigns was thus
confused in the original account; and the knowledge of the geography
ol Armenia which had grown up in Greece lrom the time ol the Ten
Thousand, and in Rome ironr that oi the Mithridatic wars, is stated by
Pliny to have entered upon a new era in his time through the additions
made to it by Corbulo and from other contemporary sources.¹ Itis
likely enough, however, that the tendency to grandiloquence noticed by
Tacitus himself in Corbulo,⁸ had lest its traces on his work in some
general exaltation ol his own personality, which hasbeen exaggerated .
to us rather than reduced, through the desire ol the historiari to throw
a strong light upon what he conceived to bea portrait ol true Roman
heroisin, in contrast to the degradation and effeminacy ol Nero.⁴
Though evidently not altogether blind to the existence of delects in his
hero,⁶ he has not allowed them to interfere with his idealization; and
