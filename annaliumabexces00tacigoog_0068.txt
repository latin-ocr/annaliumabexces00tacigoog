sunnin] RULE of NERO [59]

encouraged no doubt, and probably prompted, his bids sor popularity
in other directions, such us the largesses already mentioned,¹ the assign-
ment ol public land to veterans to recruit the decaying population ol
Italian towns‚¹ the confidence shown in the populace by the withdrawal
