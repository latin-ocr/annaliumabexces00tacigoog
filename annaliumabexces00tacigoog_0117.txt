enabled the Parthians to pose as liberators of the nation from an odious
tyranny, and had brought back the antipathy to Roman interference
in that country to much the same point at which it had stood after
the action of Antonius some ninety years earlier.¹ The accession of
a new emperor undoubtedly gave opportunity for a new departure
in policy; but the necessity of satisfying Roman public opinion and
maintaining Roman prestige on the one hand, and the facts of the
situation on the other, still operated to circumscribe it within narrow
limits.

The prompt appointment, early in 8ο8, Μ). 55, of a general ol
the character and antecedents of Corbulo,¹ satisfied public opinion at
Rome that the Parthian defiance was to be met in a corresponding spirit.
[Corbulowas appointed not to any one province, but to the command·
inchief of the war (⁴ dux belli'), and the war was to be waged not from
Syria, but from a nearer base on the Upper Euphrates, arrangements
which anticipated those afterwards adopted by Vespasian. Two of the
Syrian legions were transferred to Corbulo-P.]‚ and the neighbouring
vassal kings‚ the Jewish prince Agrippa, Antiochus of Commagene, with
Aristobulus and Sohaemus, newly appointed to rule Armenia Minor
and Sophene, are directed to assist! Corbulo promptly took possession
of his command⁴; and the mere demonstration of Roman force reveals
again, as so often formerly, the internal weakness of the Parthian
monarchy. A rebellium headed by the king’s son and apparently
strong enough to support itsels for three years,⁸ starts up3 Vologeses
hastily evacuares Armenia, and under further pressure sends hostages
chosen out of the Arsacid nobility.⁶ With this incident, and a petty
quarrel arising out of it between the ill-assorted Roman generals,' all
sight of the East for nearly three years is lost to us.

The whole following period is one in which our information is most
unsatisfactory, as compared with what might naturally have been err·
pected3 for although the Roman general is known to have been the
historian of his own campaigns, and his work is known to have been
consulted by Tacitus,⁸ many of the points chiefly interesting to students
of history are left in great obscurity. Regarding it as a military record,
