most essential point, the command of the passage ouer the Thames, was
probably stom this time secured by a permanent bridge, the approach to
which was guarded by a strong ‘castellum ’¹ ; within which met two
great roads‚ the Ermine Street leading to Camulodunum and the north,
and the Watling Street, diverted from its older and unprotected ooutse'
to one thus placed thoroughly under command It is probable also that
the approach to the bridge on the southern side was similarly protected.⁸

We· may further assume that most, is not all, ol the stations already
mentioned as permanent quarters of legions became, as elsewhere in the
empire‚ centres round which a Romanized population grew up.⁴ The
same must bave been the case with the seaports through which the com·
merce with the continent may have passed, as Portus Lemanis (Lymne),⁸
Rutupiae (Richborougl), Regulbium (Reculver), Dubris (Dover),
Portus Magnus (Porchesterh and perhaps Clausentum (usnemu
