with the insults attending it,¹ brolse down the last remains ol disci·
pline, and turned the retreat into a beadlong iligbt, in which sorty miles
nere covered in one day and the wounded abandoned all along the

bad been a Roman army encountered the troops advancing ιο their

Tacitus, il he has not directly charged any ol the blame ior this
catastrophe on Corbulo, has certainly done so by implication, in attributing
his inaction under the first message from Paetus to bis desire ιο nin
the glory os appearing as a deliverer in the last errtremity.⁸ What
explanation he may himself bave given can be only guessed nt; but it
may probably have been that the first message was in no way urgent⁸;
that a iorce supposed by him to consist of two unbrolren legions in
strong winter-quartem should bave been able to take care ot itseli ; that
in getting ready a soree ior instant action,' dispatching iton the first
really urgent message, and hastening by forced marches ιο the spot,'
he had done all that could reasonably bave been expected. Yet it cannot
be denied tbat·his whole attitude during the campaign had been that
oi one who desired not to aid but to increase his colleague's difficulties
He had sent ιο him lor the most important service the least efficient
legions⁹2 his onn elaborate preparatione, and the forts constructed along
the Euphrates, which betolened, ii anything, preparatione ior an offensive
movement, had only served to convince Vologeses that nothing oi the
kind tras intended by them,¹⁰ and that be might saiely withdraw his army
from their neighbourhood; nor had the obvious course been taken of
turning these advanced posts to account in support oi such a demonstra·
tion in iorce beyond the river as might bave recalled the invaders oi
Armenia to protect their threatened communicatione. His rejection ol
the proposal oi Paetus, to lead at once the whole force baclt into
Armenia¹¹ (from which Vologeses, apparently in great suaitsorforage,1¹
had at once retreated), is intelligible enough. The season nas too late to
