govemors are not 'seldom sent even to the most important provinces,
as Didius to Britain,¹ Quadratus to Syria3' and no less his own
astonishing ignorance of, or indifference to, the immorality of his wife,⁸
and the scandalous traffic⁴ of which the colossal fortunes amassed by
bis freedmen vas patent evidence, must be held to go -far to bear
out the charge against him. It is probably also in the later period
that the alleged judicial scandala,⁸ so far as they are well founded,
must be placed; and if the account of the trial of Asiaticus isto be
believed, any other nich cases are probable. The story of his abject
prostration during the crisis of Messalina and Silius must have been
known to many· and cannot well bea fabrication ; and the description
of his state of mind during the intrigues of his subsequent marriage,l
though resting, no doubt, on private sources only, derives credit from
what was plainly matter of public record, his speech to the praetorians
emphatically renouncing all idea of matrimony,⁸ the immediate sequence
of a decree to enable him to marry Agrippina) and the extraordinary
reasons announced by him for his selection¹⁰

Otherwise, his chief function is to condemn and punish,¹‘ which appears
to have been no uncongenial task tobim. For it is his cruelty, far
more than any other quality, that has left an indelible stain upon his
character,²⁵ and requires as its most lenient explanation the supposition
of such callous apathy as is the natural outcome of imbecility. The
number of his victims is made to reach a formidable total of all ranks
and classes 3¹⁸ and we have hideous tales of the levity with which he
