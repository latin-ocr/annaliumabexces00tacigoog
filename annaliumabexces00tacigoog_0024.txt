The boy, with his brothers and sisters, shared the triumph 01 his
iather¹, was one 01 the two with him at his death in Syria, and followed
the mournlul processioa oi his mother with the remains.² Alter this,
Tacitus makes no mention 01 him lor several years, during which time
we are told by Suetonius that he was under the tutelage first 01 his
mother, then 01 his great-grandmother Augusta,⁸ and, alter the death 01

He assumed the toga virilis at a later age than his brothers and with·
out the distinctions granted to them⁸3 and then or soon afterwards
received in marriage Junia Claudilla, daughter 01 Μ. Silanus, and accom-
panied Tiberius to Capreae· where most 01 bis next four years were

adapt every word and loolr to it; so that the witticism spread that ‘never
was there man who would be a better slave or aviler master '.¹⁰ Tiberius,
who himself had under Augustus passed through 3 similar period ol
disguise and repression, while to outward appearance satisfied with his
submissiveness, was not likely to be really deceived by it. He gave
him no higher magistracy than the quaestorship¹¹ (carrying with it
admission to the lowest rank ol senators), and no other mark 01 honour
