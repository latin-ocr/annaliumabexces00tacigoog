[118] INTRODUCYION [ΟΜΝ

though quartered in an enemy's oountry, grantirg his legions all the
indulgences usual in profound security and peace¹: again, on the
approach of the enemy, we have him alternately testing on tlte advice
of his subordinate officers and disdaining it,¹ advancing with a show
of courage and retreating in dismay at the first collision,⁸ dispersing
in the supreme crisis a force all too scanty when concentrated, and
placing his best troops in an indefensible position to be overwhelmed
by numbers‘; then, under the storm of actual attach, abandoning
all seli-possession, and sending a piteous appeal for help⁸ to the
colleague whom he had but lately hardly thought it needful even to inform
of the approach of danger,⁸ and finally, blending the strange irony
of bombastic messages to his conqueror² with a capitulation ranking
among the most ignominious in Roman history,⁸ while the ganisan
had still provisions left and was in less strait than the enemy outside,
and while the expected sucoour was hut three days distant⁰

This description, drawn no doubt chiefly from the ungenerous repre
sentations of Corbulo,¹⁰ cannot now be checfsed in respect of its particulare
from any other sources,¹¹ but corresponds at least in its general outline
with the broad facts of what actually took place. In attempting to deal
with these we bave a total absence of all geography, except the bare
mention of the Arsanias,¹¹ Mount Taurus,¹³ and Arsamosata,¹‘ and such ’
inferences as may be drawn from the statement that Paetus aimed at
recovering Tigranocerta, and at carrying the war into districts which
Corbulo had left untouched.¹⁸ We should gather that hc had crossed the
Euphrates from Cappadocia, probably near Melitene,¹⁸ and marched
through the friendly country of Sophene ¹⁷3 whence a route fed then, as
now, over the Taurus range and by Arsinia to Amida (Diarbekir), aod
