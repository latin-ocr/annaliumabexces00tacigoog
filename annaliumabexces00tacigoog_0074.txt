enar. m] RULE OF NERO [⁶5]

The divorce and murder of Octivia have been always looked upon
as beyond the reach oi question or palliation; and such details as are
given by other authors agree in the main with Tacitus.¹ We may note
how the long hesitation ol Nero was warranted by the difficulties which
actually took place, by the break down of the first attempt to set up
a charge against her through the unllinching loyalty oi most ol her
slaves, and by the reception oi the first news os her divorce with such
a demonstrationes popular feeling as had rarely set itseli up against
a Caesar.² The display oi soree with which it was met was a sufficient
deterrent to prevent a repetition³; Anicetus was only too ready to
crown one inlamy by another‘; and aster the mockery oi a domestic
trial on the renewed charge ol adultery, she was sent to the ill-omened
rocls oi Pandateria, where the end soon followed.⁶ The tragedy ol her
lile, more terrible than perhaps any in history or legend, is brought
out by the eloquent description ol the historian.⁸ Some nine years ago
she had in mere childhood entered as a bride the house which was
to bea living tomb to her; her lather’s had been followed rapidly by
her brother's murder ; her husband had treated her lrom the first with
coldness and aversion, regarding her very parentage and the popular
sympathy with her as a grievance,⁷ and had given such affection as was
in his nature to give, first to a lreedworaan, then to a rival bent on
compassing the wiie's destruction ; even in Agrippina her last protector
ol some sort was taken horn her; her degradation was embittered by
the loul outrage os the charge preferred against her; her place oi exile
called up only the memory oi those who before had perished in it; her
last piteous appeal was addressed to none but the soldiers who had
command to execute her; her liseless head was brought to be her
rival’s garing-stock. When he comes to the decree of thanksgivings
and votive offerings, Tacitus can only beg the reader to take lor granted
what be cannot bring himself to specily.⁸
