SUMMARY OF EVENTS TILL NERO'S DEAYH 475

surgents under Eleazar and his rival Manahem.¹ Alter seven days ol
comparative inaction, the contest was soon decided. The castle ol
Antonia was carried alter two days' assault, and its garrison put to the
sword ; the palace ol the Upper City, aiter a more vigorous resistance,
was evacuated under capitulation by the troops ol Agrippa, and the
remaining Romans, who had taken refuge in the three tovers ol Herod,
were induced to surrender on similar terma, and then slain in defiance ol
the agreement¹

A great massacre oi Jews by Greeks, which had taken place at the
same time³ at Caesarea, and had been followed by similar scenes at many
other places,⁴ made the struggle more internecine; and the victorious
party at Jerusalem, encouraged, as they believed, by the voice ol
prophecy,⁶ toolr the offensive in the surrounding country.

A greater crisis now ensued on the advance oi Cestius Gallus, the

legatus ol Syria· with a large lorce ol legionary and other troops, to
put down the insurrection. Alter meeting with little resistance and in·
flicting many emelties elsewhere* he sustained a severe checlr near
Beth-horon,⁸ but was enabled by the dissensions ol his adversaries to ad·
vance to the neighbourhood ol Jerusalem, and even into the city; whence,
aller leeble attempts to assault the Upper City and the Temple, he set '

out on a retreat almost degenerating intoa rout, in which nearly 6000 ol
his troops were killed’ On th'n srroeess not only Judaea, but also
