for a time the title of ‘pater patriae ’ ¹ ; ‘when Ι shall have deserved ἰι,’
is his answer declining avote of thanlrs ’γ other extravagant compliments
are refused⁸3 nor will he permit his first colleague in the consulship
to swear to his ‘acta’⁴; the first honours for which he malres request
are to the memory of his father, and to the services of his former
guardian.⁸ His liberality is shown in magnificent gifts to friends· in
the donative to the soldiers,⁷ the unusually large congiarium to the
people,⁸ the remissiori of burdens,⁸ also in a subvention, perhaps to
remedy past maladministration, to the public treasury.¹⁰ Above ali, he
is ιο wi'n renown ογ princely clemency: and speech upon speech are
composed for him‚¹¹ set ιο the straiii of the writer’s famous treatise¹²3
while their sincerity is attested by repression of delations‚¹³ by acquittals,¹⁴
mitigation or remissiori of sentences ¹⁵ ; so that whatever eredit was due
iri this respect ιο the age of Augustus, or the first period of Tiberius,
pales before the glory of a prince²⁸ who esclaims ‘would that lcould

called into action by the turn of affairs iii the East, as elsewhere
described¹⁸ lt is sufficient here to note that both in vigour of action
and definiteness of purpose, aii emphatic contrast was shown to the
weakness and corruptiori of the previous period; and that the whispered
misgivings of adverse critics ¹⁹ were not only silenced ογ the appointment
of Corbulo, but swept away iii a torrent of extravagant compliments
awarded by the senate before a blow was struck*²⁰
