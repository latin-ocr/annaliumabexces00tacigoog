that they planned it on no such paltry scale as that estimated under
Augustus,l but on one really commensurate with the magnitude and
difficulty ol the enterprise, and more nearly following the actual ex·
perience iurnished by the second expedition oi Julius Caesar.¹

Four complete legions,⁸ all well known subsequently in British war-
lare, were drasted lor the service, the ‘Secunda Augusta’ and ‘Quarta-
decima Gemina Martia’ lrorn Upper Germany, the ‘Vicesima Valeria
Victrix ' srorn Lower Germany, and the ‘ Nona Hispana' from Pannonia;
which province also lurnished a ‘vexillatio’ or detachment, probably
from 500 to 1000 strong, lrorn another ol its legions, the ‘Octava
Augusta'.⁴ This would give a strength ol lrom 20,000 to 25,000
legionaries as the nucleus ol the army, to which must be added more
than ss much again, lor the ‘alae' and ‘ cohortes' ol auxiliary or non-
citizen troops,⁸ making the whole army probably nearly ⁶0,000.·

The great llotilla collected to transport these troops and to protect
their landing was no doubt the commencement ol the ⁴ classis Britannica'3
which plays a conspicuous part in the campaigns ol' Agricola,l and
which appears afterwards to have had its principal station at Lymne
(¹ portus Lemanis 'h'
