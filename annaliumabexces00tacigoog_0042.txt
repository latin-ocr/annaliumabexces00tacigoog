achastisement at the beginning ol this period from Q. Gabinius Secundus ¹,
were still emboldened six years later to pillage the Gallie coast with small ⁶
piraticai ships.¹ This raid was energetically repulsed by Corbulo, who
had also reduced the Frisii to submission, and was preparing a bold
forward movement which would have carried him even beyond the Weser,'
when he was peremptorily ordered to withdraw behind the Rhine, and
to evacuate even what be had already won.

[This withdrawal ol the garrisons to the Roman banir was in strict accor-
danoe with the policy oi Augustus‚⁴'and was, as sar as Lower Germany is
coucemed, permanent, Roman suaerainty was indeed still recognized by
some oi the tribes nearest the Rhine,‘ and a strip of territory on the right
bank was kept clear ol Germans and reserved sor the use of the Roman
troops⁸; but that the order· ol Claudius was carried out is proved by the ,
absence os any later traces of military occupatior beyond the Lower Rhinel
such as are found along the valley of the Main opposite Mainz.-P.]

With Claudius' principal military ac'hievement, the invasion oi Britain,
we deal in a separate chapter.⁸ ·

[Among the taunts levelled at Claudius by Seneca’ none is more bitter
than that which charges him with indiscriminate liberality in granting
Roman citizenship. It is however noticeable that this particular charge

is not brought lorward as we should have expected in Nero's opening ·

speech, nor is it mentioned by Suetonius, and the positive evidence in
support os it is, to say the least, slight.

That Claudius was in favour os a policy oi liberal comprehension is
proved by his famous speech.¹⁰ It is also certain that he gave an impulse
to Roman colonication, and added substantially to the number os Roman
‘municipia’ in the provinces.

Among his colonies the most famous were Colonia Agrippinensis ¹¹
(Cologne) and Camulodunum¹¹ (Colchester). To these may be added
Savaria ¹⁸ in Pannonia, Apri¹⁴ in Thrace, Aequum¹⁸ in Dalmatia, and
Caesarea and Oppidum Novum iu Mauretania¹⁸ In Noricum the elder
