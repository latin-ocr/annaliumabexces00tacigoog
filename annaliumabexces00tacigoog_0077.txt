to the voice ol the people, come lorward with a show ol reluctance, harp
in hand, scrupulously observing the minutest rules ol professional
etiquette, making his obeisance to the demoralized assemblage, and
trembling, or allecting to tremble, before his judges.¹ We are shown
the contrast oi the drilled and disciplined applause, and well-assumed,
if not genuine enthusiasm oi his great clientele, the Roman rabble?
with the ill-concealed contempt oi the municipal, provincial, and other
respectable sections oi the audience, who had to bear the blows ol the
soldiers at one moment lor slaclsness‚ at another ior ill-timed clapping.
We have the higher classes, not daring to be absent, some crushed
to death in the press, some struck down in their seats by diseases
arising irorn exhaustion, with every look ol weariness and disgust noted
down by spies and sure to be sooner or later resented, and Vespasian
scolded by a ireedman ior nodding in slumber, and brought into such
peril as well-nigh to baullr his destiny.

lt must be borne in mind that, side by side with the genuine and
righteous feeling ol disgust at this degradation ol imperial majesty,

gances ol Gaius,⁸ wasa less creditable current ol old Roman prejudice
against Greelr amusements.⁴ This is seen in lull strength in the
murmurs at the institution os the ‘Neronia ',⁸ where Tacitus ireely
admits that the iorce oi argument was not wholly on one side} and
that the gloomy anticipations were not justified by the result' Ata
time when theold national military exercises, invidiously contrasted
with the palaestra,⁸ must have been growing more and more obsolete,
we can see that the best minda should have weloomed, on the acore
of humanity and refinement, any counter·attraction to that oi the amphi-
theatre3 but the leeling above noted is certainly a soree to be estimated,
as also the dismay lelt at the rush oi the Roman nobility to hire them-
selves out for the stage, the circus, or the arena. Such precedente as
had already existed' must have served only to set off a contrast in
