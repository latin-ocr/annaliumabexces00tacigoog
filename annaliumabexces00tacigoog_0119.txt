[κιο] INTRODUCTION [anl’.1v

throughout the whole history of the var he has selected nach incidents
alone for prominenoe as concern Corbulo personally, and has frequently
sacrificed the general narrative of events to biographieal particulam.

What has been said above will serve to explain the necessity of here
supplementing the narrative of Tacitus by such a geographical and
chronological shetch as vill malae it intelligibfe.

It may be sufficient for the former purpose to hace the three chief
mountain systema forming the highlands of Armenia and the river basina
and plains of various elevation enclosed by them.¹ The central and
highest range, that of the Dujik mountains, aprolongation of the Anti·
Taurus, parts at its western extremity the two branches of the Upper
Euphrates, the Murad and the Jephrat or Rara-Su 3 and is prolonged
under the names of Dujih Dagh, Binghol Dagh, and others, rising at
its eastern extremity to the two highest points in the whole country,
those of Great and Little Ararat; at the foot of the latter of which the
basin of the Erasch (Araxes) isjoined to that of its tributary the Balylr.
The southern range, treated ss s prolongation of Taurus, or Taurus
Niphates, parts the basin of the Murad from that of the Upper Tigris¹
under the name of Mush Dagh, and divides at the great plain of Lake Van
into the Arjeroscb and Erdoz Dagh south of the lake, and Jebel Nimrud
and Sapan Dagh at the north of it, rising further to the north-east to the

Ala Dagh,⁸ in which the Murad and Balylr find their source and vater·

shed. The northern range, enclosing the whole country in its sweep,
divides in its western portion the basin of the Kana-Su from that of the
Ioruh (Akampsis), and in its eastern that of the Araxes from that of the
Kur (Cyrus); the vatersbed of the Kana-Su and Araxes being found on
the high table-lande, the highest in the whole country and near yooo feet
