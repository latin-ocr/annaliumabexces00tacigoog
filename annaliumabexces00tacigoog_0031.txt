to all, but also what may have lain beneath the surface ; whether not
only this tame submission to every kind of insuit, but even some studied
exaggeration of his natural weakness and eccentricity, may not have
been assumed for seii-protection,¹ as according to the old tale was the
demeanour of Brutus under Tarquinius, or as had been the servility of
Gaius himself under Tiberius.¹ It can, indeed, be hardly doubted that
his position had another side to it, at a time when aii thinking men could
foresee that the existing tyranny must needs be shortiived; that its out·
come would nothe (as some fondiy dreamt) a return to the old Republic,
but the succession of some other prinoeps; that while direct or collateral
descendants of Augustus lived, their names would weigh powerfuliy in
the scale against any others ; and that within that circle Claudius, with
all his drawbacks, was most prominent.⁸

It was not without politicai foresight that the freedman Callistus chose
to pay court to Claudius rather than destroyhim‘ ς that his old friend
Herodes Agrippa stili kept up his intimacy⁸ ; that the senate as a body
paid him what was evidently intended as a compliment by choosing him
on the deputation above referred to.⁸ Nor can we suppose him to have
been himself so obtuse as not to keep an eye on his own prospecta

that he contracted during this period a lar higher matrimonial alliance
than any oi his previous ones, by taking to wife Valeria Messalina, who
was a direct descendant, through both her parents, from Octavia,i and
