cuae. v] CONQUEST oF BRITAIN [¹41]

Otherwise, the catastrophe appears to have made little differenee,
except that no more pitched battles are rislred, and that the tactics
previously successful are steadily adhered to. Almost immediately aster
the sall of Caratacus, it is found necessary to fix the permanent head·
quarters ol the Second legIon at Isca Silumm¹ (Caerleon on usk); and
the position is with the greatest difficulty established. Ar one time the
lorec on the spot is barely reseued irom utter destruction hythe timely
support ol' the main army ς’ at another, the foraging parties are cut off ³3
at another, the whole legion sustains a reverse, and the Silures, rendered
only more desperate by threats oi extermination,⁴ are again masters oi
the country and draw other tribes to juin them.⁶ From this time too
the hostility of the poweriul Brigantes iu the North has to be reclroned
with3 and Venutius, one oi their princes, comes to the iront as the most
skilsrd national leader.⁸

Early iu these renevved troubles Ostorius died at his post, worn out by
continual variare ;τ and during the live years oi Didius Gallus⁸ and the
one year oi Veranius· (805-srr‚ au. 52-58) no advance of dominion is
noted; though it is probable that in this period oi seeming inaction the
chains oi oonquest were being firmly riveted upon the land within and
slightly beyond the space already subjected ¹⁰; that Isca and probably its
subordinate post Venta (Caerwent) are strongly held against the Silures,
Viroconium against the Ordovices; while Deva (Chester) and Lindum
(Lincoln) form also outposts confronting the Brigantes; each oi these
four positione becuming the headquarters oi a legion; and all being
connected vvith each other and with their bases ol support in the south·
east oi the province by the long lines oi the Foss Way and the Watling
Street, and their subsidiary branchos.¹¹
