personai vanity, and the desire to outdo his predecessore, must count
ior something. Suetonius, as might be expected, thinks bia desire to win
the iuli honours ol 3 triumph a sufficient explanation ol tire whole under·
taking¹; and the monotony with which the rhetorical boast, that he had
been first to extend the empire beyond the Ocean, is paraded in his own
speech* in the triumphai inscription,⁸ and in contemporary epigrams,⁴
shows the iight in which he wished the achievement to be regarded. The
prominence oi Narcissus in the narrative oi the dispatch ol the expedition⁸
suggests the cupidity oi' i'reedmen and other courtiers as another great ·
prompting motive,‘and that the increased trade may have led the Romans
to exaggerate the minerai and other weaitb oi Britain no less than they
had before depreciated it.² It must be remembered, however, that the
situation created by Cunobeline's death was such as would naturally caii
ior Roman intervention in South Britain. Cunobeline bad clearly been
the ⁴ aiiy and sriend oi Rome ', and recognized by Rome as king. On his
death, it was ior Rome either to recognize his heir as iring, or substitute
another successor, or finally to annea the kingdom. The ability and anti·
Roman sentimenta of Caratacus appeared to the imperial governnrent to
make annexation necessary.

The circumstances oi the time were favourable to a new extension ci'
the empire, in so iar as the general tranquillity on the northern and
north-eastem frontier allowed the garrisons there stationed to be re·
duced below the strength which Augustus (in his later years) and
Tiberius had considered necessary.⁸ It is, however, to the credit oi
those who organized this expedition, that they loresaw that it couid not
be undertaken without some augmentation oi the standing army,l and
