above the sea, os Eraeroumand Pasin ; from which descend eastward the
districts os Kars and Erivan; in tbe latter os which, οιι the bank oi the
Araxes, and near the northern loot ol Great Ararat, lay Artaxata, the
ancient capital. The roads and passes in such a country were lew and
difficult, and most ol them during great part oi the year impracticable3
the routes most open to an invader t‘rom the west being either to cross
the Euphrates near Melitene (Malatia) in Cappadocia, and follow the
course ol either ol its branches, orto take one ol the lines further north,
ansvering ιο modern caravan roads, from Armenia Minor and Pontus,
or from the Black Sea at Trapezus (Trebizond), to the table-land oi
Erzeronm, and thence to strike at Artaxata. On the south, the vulner-
able point was the Bitlis pass, on the west side os Lake Van, communi·
cating with the plain oi Mush in the centre ol the country'; whence again
the Κιγιιίι pass, over the central mountain ranges, east of the Binghol
Dagh, led directly to the plateau ol Eraeroum.¹ How lar south ol the
Bitlis pass the limits ol Armenia extended is an uncertain point; still
more so tbe situation ol Tigranocerta· stated ιο bave lain on the extreme
southern lrontier ol the kingdom,⁸ on an elevated site,⁴ and close to
a river known to Tacitus aa the Nicephorius.⁸

As regards tbe chronology, while it appears clear that the narrative
in Book ¹5⁶ is that belonging to the years 814-817‚ an. 61-63, the
apponionment of tbe narrative in the two previous Books among the
preceding years is matter ol great difficulty3 and the only winter
mentioned ιιι that period⁷ has been assigned by critica ιο three
different years.

lt we reckon back lrom what seems clearly made out, the first question
will be whether the events ol ιι. ²3- -26, related, as they are, wholly
without a break, are those ol the year 813, an. 60, alone, or ol the
, previous year also: we have again to ask whether the beginning oi this
narrative is to be taken as separated lrom that ending in 13.41, 4, by an
intervening unmentioned winter; whether again the events ol ¹3· 34·41
are those os one campaign οι two, and whether the beginning of actual
hostilities is ιο be placed in 811, an. 58, or the preceding year.

As regards the first question, Egli’s arguments⁸ seem clearly to show
