could have been hardly more lit for active service than his own had
been five years previously. On the other hand, tn possible means
were taken to securo the' frontier of Syria on the Euphrates, and even
ιο threaten an advanoe from it¹; and Tigranes, behind the among

from what is represented as a disadvantageous and untenable position,
no less an equivalent than the evacuation of Tigranocerta, the retreat
of the whole Roman army to such winter quarters aa it could liud
