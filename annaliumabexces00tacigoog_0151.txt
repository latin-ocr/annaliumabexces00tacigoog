'l'he necessity for some central garrison in the established province to
make up lor this withdrawal ol' the legions to its outposts had been
,soreseen ; and it was apparently early in the govemment 01 Ostorius that
the island received its first Roman colony¹ ς 111 the site ol which, in
spite oi tbe greater commercia} importance ol Londinium,l the cboice
naturally l'ell on what had probably been lrom the time ol' its occupatiori
the seat ol government, the old capital 01 Cunobelinus⁸; which had
assumed under him an importance eclipsing that oi all other British
‘oppida ', though still apparently resembling the general type‘ in con·
sisting oi a large enclosed tract ol some square miles, protected on the
east, north, and south hythe tidal marshes 01 the Colne and its small
tributary (still called the Roman river), and on its assailable side, the
west, by strong earthworks, in part still traceable, from stream to
stream.⁸ On the formation oi the colony, a theatre,‘ and, no doubt,
other public buildings rapidly grew up, and a temple was erected to
Claudius,i to become, as other such had been, the provincial centre of the
cultus 01 Rome ’ς but the whole place was laid out rather as a pleasure
resort than a military position,’ and 1ο pains were taken to strengthen
its antiquated deiences. Here, and at the large municipal town oi
Verulamium, and most oi all at Londinium, we are told ol a great
population, Roman and Romaniaed,¹⁰ living in a fatal dream of security
destined to undergo a rude awalrening.
