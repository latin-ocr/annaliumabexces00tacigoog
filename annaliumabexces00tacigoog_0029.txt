[ao] INTRODUCTION [cusum

and gifted brother was pushed forward rapidly in public lise, and known
by only one redeeming uait his early passion for study. Augustus
indeed, though by no means allowing him to make an exhibition of
himself in public, showed some regard for him in private life, and had
the insight to sce that when he could command his faculties, he was by
no means the fool he seemed¹: yet even he, though thus showing more
consideration than other and nearer relatives, was so far dissatisfied with
him as to allow him no other distinction than an augurship, and to give
hirn only a low position and triding legacy in his will¹ ; while from the
stern and ungenial Tiberius he had less indulgence to expect. He was
now eamestly desirous os filling the magistracies of state, but was put off
with the ‘ornamenta consularia’; a further request was met with the
contemptuous gill of a few gold pieces to spend at the Satumalia³ ς and
he retired into shadow during the rest ol this prince's rule, with no
further distinction than that of a place among the 'sodales Augustales '.⁴
Though now the head of the Claudian house,⁸ second only in dignity to
the Julian, he had no position in tbe senate· and merely ranked as a
knight⁷ Α trivial incident showing the tendency of all men to take no
account of him⁸ gives Tacitus an opportunity for the bitter comment,
‘the more i think on ancient or recent examples, the more is the mockery
pervading human affairs in all matters made evident to me. By repu-
tation, by promise, by the respect of men, any one seemed rather destined
to imperial dignity tban he whom fortune was reserving in secret as the
future prince'

Thus to the twenty-four years of cbildhood and youth under Augustus
are to be added twenty-two more, passed in complete retirement under
Tiberius, in which, despised by those of his own rank, and bashiul in good
society,he took refugeinlowhabits and lowcompany.' These surroundings
