Elsewhere, our only record of foreign or provincial affairs ia that
better appointments seem to be made, and imperial interests seem more
cared lor than under the later Claudian rule. Veranius, lrorn whom
much was expected, succeeds Didius in Britain, and ou his speedy death
is succecded at the close ol this period by Suetonius Paulinus¹3 anew
legatus ol Lower Germany takes prompt action against occupatione ol'
territory previously overlooked ¹; a corrupt practice by which provincial
governors managed to win condonation sor their iniquities by indulging
their people with gladiatorial shows, is forbidden*

As regards the home government‚ while the senate is encouraged
to the discharge ol the duties left to it,⁴ the supersession ol so many
ol its iunctione and those oi its magistrates, by procuratore and other
imperial officere, continues as under the Claudisn system⁸3 and an
important further step is taken towards withdraving the public treasury
lrom senatorial control by placing it under praelecti, who, though
senators ol high rank, were the emperor’s officere.⁰ But the general
reaction against Claudian venality and corruption is emphasised by
the dismissa! oi Pallas,l and appointment ol a successor whose qualities
made him long acceptahle.⁸ The same spirit is manifested in the
onslaught on the extortions ol the ‘publicani', an occasion memorable
lor the impulsiva proposal recorded as directly originated by Nero, to
abolish ‘vectigalia' generally! Ii we are to suppose the measure
contemplated to have been really as sweeping as Tacitus has conceived
it to be,¹⁰ and that the young emperor had any real comprehension
ol its scope,¹¹ and any deliberate idea ol establishing universal iree
trade throughout the empne, and leaving its whole income to be
levied by direct tribute on the provincial subjecta, we must see init
the first and most striking assertion ol a purpose, more or less present
in all his extravagances, ol ruling by popular support. His
