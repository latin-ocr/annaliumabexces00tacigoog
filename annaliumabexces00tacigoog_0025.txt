that he had read his character rightly: ‘He would bave Sulla's vices witlr·
out his virtues,'¹ ‘He would be a serpent to the Roman people, a
Phaethon to the world.'¹

The old man would gladly have so ordered the sucoession' as to set
aside the adoptive grandson lorthegrandson by blood3 but the knowledge
that Tiberius Gemellus was too young, and that in any case the tide ol
popular lavour would run high for the son ol Germanicus, led him to leave
the future to take its own course, though he could see from the soowl
with which the elder looked on the younger what that course would be.⁴

Gaius again had shrewdness enough to see that, whether Tiberius
intended to attempt to provide lor the succession or not, the real masters oi
the situation were the praetorians, arrd that their praelect would be his best
ally. Nor was Macro in his turn slow to ‘worship the rising instead oi the
setting sun ’, and even to sacrifice his wiie’s honour to cernent the allianoe.⁸

All could see the direction in which aliairs were tending3 and the
eminent senator, L. Arruntius, is represented as choosing imnediate

· suicide, rather than await amore rigorous slavery, under the rule oi an

ignorant youth ‘brought up under the vilest influences, with Macro to
gulde him '.⁸

The end came in due course, not without dark stories os the personal
share ol Macro and Gaius in its acceleration'3 aod from this point the
guidance ol Tacitus is lost to us.

We are led however to believe, from what has been already noted,
that Tacitus would have regarded bis subsequent conduct, as he bas that
ol Tiberius, as that ol a natural tendency revealing itsell, though by less
gradual stages, on the merc removal ol enforced disguise. We should
suppose birn to have entirely disbelieved that the popular acts and pro·
lessions oi the young prince at the beginning ol rule showed any sincere
intention to govern justly and moderately‚ or that the succeeding insanity,
whatever its nature and degree,⁸ which by most accounts was as much
the effectas the cause ol reclrless prodigacy, had any other eliect on his
moral character than so iar as it led him rnore completely to drop the
