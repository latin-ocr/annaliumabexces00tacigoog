souin-law of Claudius and a representative oi the name of the famous

nards, on some preterit not made public,⁴ soldiers had been sent to
execute the exiles without more ad03 avague and general report being
laid before the senate afterwards, to be followed by the mockery of
posthumous condemnation' Higher even than that oi either of these was
the lineage of the Junii Silani, the only direct descendants of Augustus·
save Nero himself; and the onslaught on this family commenced by
Agrippinai was carried on by Nero in 817, nn. 64, by a private trial,
resulting in the death of its chief living representative.⁸
