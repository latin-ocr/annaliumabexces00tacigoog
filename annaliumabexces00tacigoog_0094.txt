erran. ιιι] RULE OF NERO [85]

step his secession¹ from the state; and it was easy to conceive him as
another Tubero or Favonius, as bent on ‘first destroying the empire sor
liberty, then liberty itseli' sor something yet more visionary.¹

Ii Nero contemplated any general blow at the whole body,¹ he took, as
was usual with him, but one step at a time, and struck down those only
whose position gave importance to their tenets. Even as it was, to force
the senate to condemn such men vas beyond anything which he had yet
demanded oi it; and there may have been as much real timidity as
artifice in choosing the moment when public attention was taken off by
the approach of Tiridates,⁴ in the rescript pointing to Thrasea without
venturing to name him‚⁸ in raising the cry that the whole constitution was
at stake, in menacing the senate, apparently under pretext oi promerion,
with an unprecedented show ol military force.¹

ot the one long day's sitting¹ we have but the record oi the touching
desence ol Servilia and Soranus,⁸ oi the baseness oi one client oi the
latter¹ and the loyalty of another,¹¹ of the intimidated senate in the midst
ol bristling weapons, yet deeply moved by the memory of the venerabie
leader ¹¹ who had not stooped to iace the indignity of trial‚¹¹ and powerless
to aequit even his still more innocent associates.¹⁸ Beyond this, we have
the bare decision‚ the vote oi an enormous reward to the accusem,
and the hardly complete description oi the end oi Thrasea‚¹⁴ reminding
usin many points of that ol Seneca. 1t such death scenes seem to us
to be rather theatrical than genuine, it is well to be reminded that
‘it is the privilege os patriota in miserable times to be excited, strained‚
unnatural ; and hence we can understand how it vas that from the

Girondists oi France the Roman Stoice obtained such sympathy and .

admiration '.¹⁸
