cuae. 111] RULE OF CLAUDIUS [37]

at the shortlived addition 01 letters to the alphabet,¹ the affectation of
archaic spelling,¹ the attempt 10 rescue from deserved decay the obsolete
lore of the aruspices,¹ might also have the satisfaction of pointing out
that their august professor did not aiter all lrnow the ancient meaning 01
the term ‘libertinus',¹ and had forgotten his own researchea on the
computation 01 an Etruscan ‘saeculum '.¹

again, much as we may set down to a conscientious intention to
discharge a public duty, and to a desire of emulating Augustus,¹ we
must ascribe also in no small degree to vanity and selfconceit that
passion for the personal exercise 01 judicial functions which all authorities
attest,⁷ and which, notwithstanding the record that many of his decisions
were shrewd and original,¹ and that some of the principles 01 law
embodied in his judgements or legislative enactments are quoted with
approval long afterwards by juristic writers,¹ could not have worked
generally for the public benedt Even in ordinary cases such encroach·
ment by tbe princeps in Rome and by his procurators elsewhere¹⁰ on
the ordinary tribunals was an injudicious wealcening of their authority;
nor could all the assiduity of Claudius prevent accumulation of arrears
and harassing delays, shortened (if we are to believe our authors) by very
summary modes of expedition ; ¹¹ while, in cases involving graver charges,
‘a prince who centred in himself all fonctions of law and magistracy ' ¹¹
was but calling into existence and enriching acrowd of accusers to whom
condemnations and collusive acquittals alike were profitable.¹¹ They
